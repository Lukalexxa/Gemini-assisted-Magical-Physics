DROTH'SWORN SPECIES PROFILE: THE SIMULATION INPUT
Applied Physics and Genetic Engineering Protocol (V5.1 - Material Stratification)

This document defines the physical capabilities, specialized hardware, and operational constraints of the Droth'sworn, based on their material resource hierarchy.
PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL CAPACITY AND HARDWARE

The full capacity is only achieved by the Apex Caste who receives the pure exotic materials. Lower castes are defined by their materials budget.
1.1 Apex Caste Inherent Biological Capacity (The Absolute Max)

This profile applies exclusively to the 10,000 core Apex Caste members who receive Carbyne and 58 kg of pure exotic neural mass.

|

| Constraint | Value | Physics Derivation |
| Mana Capacity (EMAX​) | 130,000 mana | Derived from 58 kg neural mass and specialized 1,724 mana/kg conversion rate. |
| Max Strength | ≈47 Tons Lift (300× human) | Derived from Carbyne Skeleton tensile strength. |
| Kinetic Reaction Time | 0.01 ms (10 microseconds) | Derived from Superconducting Pathways (pure exotic tissue). |
1.2 Resource Stratification

| Caste | Skeletal Material | Neural Hardware Quality | Living Tool Access |
| Apex | Pure Carbyne | 96% Exotic Material (Superconducting) | Manarite (Quantum-stabilized alloy) |
| Scion | Titanium-Aluminide Alloy (15× human strength) | 70% Enhanced Organic Polymer (0.5 ms Latency) | Ferrofluid Composite (Magnetite/Iron-based substitute) |
| Worker | Titanium-Polymer Mesh (5× human strength) | 50% Enhanced Organic Polymer (1 ms Latency) | Crude Ferrofluid (Minimal stability, non-weaponized) |
PART 2: ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND SYMBIOSIS
2.1 Manarite / Ferrofluid Management

The effectiveness of the living metal tool is entirely dependent on its material composition.

| Component | Apex (Manarite) | Scion (Ferrofluid Composite) | Physics Trade-Off | | Conductivity | Zero-Resistance (Superconducting) | High Resistance (Magnetite/Iron) | Lower conductivity increases waste heat when channeling energy. | | Thermal Shunt | Perfect (External Cooling) | Poor (Internal Stress) | Ferrofluid lacks Graphene's radiative properties, forcing waste heat back into the user's system. | | Kinetic Capacity | 9,000 kg Force | ∼1,500 kg Force | The substitute material cannot safely channel the extreme RF amplitude needed for the full 9,000 kg force multiplier. | | Complexity Bypass | Full access to Consciousness Node (CN). | Limited to 20% of CN capacity. | Slower neural pathways cannot process the CN's full computational speed. |
PART 3: HIERARCHY AND CASTE STRUCTURE

The power of the lower castes is now defined by their maximum capacity utilizing their restricted materials.
3.1 The Scion Caste (Technicians and Engineers)

The Scion Caste is defined by structural limits imposed by their Titanium-Aluminide skeleton and lower-grade neural tissue.

| Constraint | Scion Caste Specification | Simulation Impact |
| Max Strength | ∼15× Human Lift (∼2,200 kg) | Their skeleton cannot withstand the 9,000 kg recoil of the Apex. |
| Mana Capacity | 40,000 mana (Scaled) | Lower neural density reduces the maximum stable thermal limit and Mana storage capacity. |
| Kinetic Reaction | 0.5 ms Latency | While 200× faster than humans, they are 50× slower than the Apex, eliminating their advantage against high-speed threats. |
| Resource Dependency | Must frequently stop casting to internally cool their systems, as the Ferrofluid is a poor thermal shunt. |  |
3.2 The Worker Caste (Labor and Infrastructure)

The Worker Caste is engineered for cost-effective labor with minimal RF application.

| Constraint | Worker Caste Specification | Simulation Impact |
| Max Strength | ∼5× Human Lift (∼750 kg) | Still superhuman, but relies on mass over RF infusion. |
| Mana Capacity | 15,000 mana (Minimal Reserve) | Provides only enough energy for sustained labor and emergency self-defense. |
| Technology | Crude Ferrofluid | The tool cannot form weapons; it only assists in lifting and infrastructure work, functioning as an external crane. |
