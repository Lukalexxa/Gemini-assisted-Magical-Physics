DROTH'SWORN SPECIES PROFILE: THE SIMULATION INPUT
Applied Physics and Genetic Engineering Protocol (V5.0)

This document defines the physical capabilities, specialized hardware, and operational constraints of the Droth'sworn, a post-space age species, for accurate simulation within the RF Physics Engine (v2.5).
PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL CAPACITY AND HARDWARE

The Droth'sworn's power derives from their multi-material hybrid architecture, which bypasses all human biological limits.
1.1 Inherent Biological Capacity (The Absolute Max)

The Droth'sworn capacity is constrained by the thermal limits of their exotic materials and the volume of their 58 kg distributed neural mass.

|

| Constraint | Value | Physics Derivation |
| Mana Capacity (EMAX​) | 130,000 mana | Derived from 58 kg neural mass and specialized 1,724 mana/kg conversion rate. |
| Kinetic Reaction Time | 0.01 ms (10 microseconds) | Derived from Superconducting Pathways (signal v≈1,000,000 m/s) and Electroactive Polymers. |
| Max Strength | ≈47 Tons Lift (300× human) | Derived from Carbyne Skeleton tensile strength and 100% molecular motor efficiency. |
| Net Recovery Rate | 587 to 787 mana/hour | Governed by BMR income and low Thermal Shunt RF tax (13 mana/hour mandatory drain). |
1.2 Complexity Ceiling (The Processing Limit)

The Droth'sworn's 58 kg distributed neural mass gives them 41× the processing capacity of humans, but they are still limited by how quickly they can process complex molecular data.
Complexity Ceiling=41×1024 Processing Clusters

| Complexity Tier | Example Material | Droth'sworn Max (Augmented) | Rationale |
| Tier 2 (Stone/Water) | Simple Crystalline Structure | ∼410 Liters (Total Bulk Control) | Maximum volume for moving simple materials. |
| Tier 3 (Biological/Exotic) | Active, Non-linear Proteins | ∼82 Liters (Total Precision Control) | Maximum volume for complex fabrication or life-form manipulation. |
PART 2: ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND SYMBIOSIS

The Droth'sworn utilize living, self-managing tools to bypass biological limitations.
2.1 Manarite: The Living Exotic Conduit

Manarite is an encoded, symbiotic Quantum-Stabilized Eutectic Alloy (60% Gallium, CNT, Graphene) that serves as the ultimate external RF management tool.

| Component | Function / Physics Rationale | Impact on User |
| Armor/Weapon | External Thermal Shunt: Manarite's surface area absorbs and radiates waste heat (T4 cost), preventing neural damage during high-power RF discharge. | Unlocks Full Potential: Allows the user to channel massive Thermal and Kinetic energy without biological failure. |
| Kinetic Conduit | Zero-Resistance Channel: The alloy provides a superconducting path for RF energy, concentrating force into a hyper-dense weapon edge. | Force Multiplier: Enhances the 300× strength by channeling the Kinetic Impulse with near-perfect efficiency. |
| Storage | Integrated RF Battery. Micro-cavities in the alloy store ∼5,000 mana externally. | Power Buffer: Augments the internal reserve and automatically funds high-cost movement spells. |
| Passive Drain | Continuous RF Tax: Manarite draws 2 to 5 mana/hour from the bonded partner to maintain its coherence and consciousness. | Increased Tax: Added to the user's base 13 mana/hour drain. |
2.2 The Consciousness Node (CN)

The CN is an integrated, specialized crystalline neural processor that manages complex computation.

| Function | Physics Rationale | Simulation Impact |
| Complexity Bypass | Shared Neural Workload: The CN absorbs the processing burden for high-volume manipulation tasks. | Raises Ceiling: Raises the practical Complexity Ceiling by 20% to 50% for the task it is dedicated to. |
| Tactical Processing | Prediction Co-Processor: Runs continuous 10,000 scenario/sec probability models, communicating with the primary brain via the Manarite's Superconducting Pathways. | Enhanced Strategy: Augments the user's 30-second tactical precognition, making combat simulations virtually flawless. |
| Integration | Passive Drain: Requires 5 to 10 mana/hour to maintain processing stability (added to the Manarite's tax). |  |
PART 3: OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL (Simulation Rules)
3.1 Proxy Species Creation Protocol

The Droth'sworn's strategy relies on creating proxy forces using advanced molecular manipulation.

| Resource Requirement | Cost (per 1 kg of proxy biomass) | Physics Basis |
| Energy (Fabrication) | 800 to 1,500 mana | Cost scales linearly with the complexity of tissue being assembled (Tier 3 manipulation). |
| Time (Growth Rate) | 4 to 8 hours | Limited by the speed of molecular diffusion and chemical bonding (Latency Penalty). |
| Processing (Oversight) | ∼80 Liters of dedicated capacity | A dedicated Droth'sworn must commit a majority of their Complexity Ceiling to supervision to prevent structural failure. |

Genetic Injection Policy: All proxies are engineered with specific RF hardware (e.g., Kinetic Synchronization or Anti-Coherence Filters) to maximize their effectiveness against the human Adventuring Party.
3.2 Strategic and Tactical Rules

| Protocol | Rule and Physics Constraint | Simulation Impact |
| Force Multiplier | 0.01 ms reaction time must be utilized to ensure every attack is fatal or immediately crippling (no prolonged engagements). | Immediate Victory Mandate: Combat simulations must prioritize the fastest possible action over sustained defense. |
| Energy Threshold | Never commit more than 5% of the 130,000 mana pool (6,500 mana) to a single non-critical engagement. | Attrition Policy: If victory requires 6,501 mana, the Droth'sworn must retreat immediately and use proxies or artifacts instead. |
| Logistics Check | All sustained movement (Mach 1+ flight, etc.) requires a continuous check against the 587 mana/hour net recovery rate. | Sustainability Check: If cost exceeds net recovery, the action must have a defined duration before pool depletion forces retreat. |
PART 4: HIERARCHY AND CASTE STRUCTURE

The Droth'sworn maintain a strict caste system based on structural augmentation and access to advanced technology.

| Caste Name | Biological Structure | Primary Role in Simulation |
| The Apex Caste | Full 58 kg Neural Mass, Carbyne Skeleton, Manarite, CN Access. | Warfare, Research, Leadership. (The 10,000 core fighting and strategic force.) |
| The Scion Caste | Reduced Neural Mass (∼20 kg), no Carbyne, no Manarite. | Technicians, Scientists, Engineers. (The high-caste support population, managing data and non-combat infrastructure.) |
| The Worker Caste | Minimal Specialized Tissue. | Labor, Infrastructure, Service. (The base population, lacking combat RF capacity.) |
