# Chapter 1, Part I: Under Stone

Six hours holding up rubble, and Vert couldn't feel his legs anymore.

The pressure wasn't just weight; it was a living, burning vise across his back where timber pressed through splintered stone. He tasted copper and ash. His lungs made a wet, tearing sound every time he tried to pull air in. But he held.

The child beneath him hadn't moved. Just watched him with those strange green eyes that never blinked, speaking in that flat voice that made his skin crawl even through the pain.

"Designation: Human-baseline, male. Age: Twenty-two Chron-Units. Status: Structural integrity failing by factor thirty-one." She paused, tilting her head. "Termination cascade initiated two Major Cycles past. Spinal integrity: declining. Yet: continuation. Anomaly logged. Fascinating."

By Leniha, what kind of child talks like that?

He tried to tell her to run, but blood came out instead of words. It sprayed across her white dress. She studied the arc with detached interest.

"Arterial spray trajectory: seventy-three degrees. Volume: approximately twelve Mililites. Systemic failure progressing within expected parameters." She looked up. "Termination sequence is no longer required."

He couldn't let go. He felt the conviction deep in his chest—that pure, cold sense of duty. He had to hold. You held the line. You saved the innocent.

Even when the innocent didn't seem to understand what being saved meant.

Elena.

God, Elena's face when the lance went in. The surprise in her eyes. Her hands flying to her belly, trying to protect—

No. Don't think about it. Just hold.

"Biological stress indicators spiking," the child announced, reaching up to touch his face with fingers cold as winter stone. "Heart rate: 142 BPM. Core temperature: dropping. Hypothesis: emotional distress accelerating metabolic failure."

The building groaned. More weight shifting. Everything going dark at the edges.

"You're... a child," he managed. The words came out garbled, but she seemed to process them instantly.

"Classification accepted. However, structural integrity of protective entity failing. Twenty Marks to complete architectural collapse. This unit possesses self-extraction capability. Query remains: Why continue?"

The child watched him die with those empty green eyes. No fear. No gratitude. Just... observation.

"Recording," she said quietly. "Recording everything."

# Part II: The Deserter's Choice (Twelve Hours Earlier)

The woman's screams had stopped. That was worse than when they'd started.

Vert Vozaprime stood in his commander's tent, sword still dripping blood onto expensive carpets. Two women huddled against tent poles, chained like animals, clothes torn, eyes empty. Used for sport. For entertainment.

Six months ago, this would have been unthinkable. His commander had been a hard man but honorable. Now he was dead on his own tent floor, wine cup still in hand.

"You've lost your mind, Vozaprime." Lieutenant Kress stepped over the body like it was furniture. "Killing a superior over some enemy whores?"

Vert felt the rage—not fear, but a searing, pure heat that pooled instantly in the center of his chest. The control that usually stopped him was no longer there. It was rage that felt like power.

"When did this start?" Vert’s voice shook, thick with moral horror. "When did we become this?"

"When winning became all that mattered." Kress drew his blade. "You know what happens to deserters."

The fight was brief. When Kress drew his blade, Vert’s body moved with an awful, mechanical finality. He slammed his blade into Kress’s guard with a blinding, uncontrolled surge of force. The impact overloaded Kress's arm instantly. A searing spike of acute pain shot up Vert's own shoulder as the recoil overflowed his center, but he ignored it. Kress lay screaming in his own blood.

Vert cut the women free with shaking hands. They shuffled away without looking at him, broken beyond thanks.

Marcus found him standing over Kress, then David. His sword-brothers from their first campaign, back when they'd believed the war had meaning.

"What the fuck," Marcus breathed, seeing the scene. "What have we become?"

"That's why I did it." Vert's hands wouldn't stop shaking. "This isn't war anymore. It's something else."

"Started six months back," David muttered, voice low. "First just the bar fights getting meaner. Then the whippings for no reason. Last month, the first torture for sport. This week..." He gestured at the tent. "This."

"Whole camp's mobilizing," Marcus said, no judgment in his voice. "Deserter hunters. We should—"

"Not we. Me." Vert wiped his blade clean. "This is my choice."

"Our choice," Marcus corrected. "We've avoided seeing for far too long already. Your wife?"

"Eastern gate."

They moved through the camp's shadows. Everywhere Vert looked, he saw horrors that hadn't existed six months ago. Soldiers torturing prisoners for entertainment. Officers placing bets on how long they’d last. Like something was poisoning them all, getting worse each day.

Elena waited with a supply wagon, seven months pregnant, steady despite everything.

"Thank God," she said when she saw him. "I thought you'd finally become like them."

"Never." He helped her onto the wagon. "We're getting out. All of us."

The sound of hooves made them turn. Ten riders with lances, torches turning their armor to flame.

"Go," Marcus ordered, already moving to position. "That's not a request, Captain."

"We stand together—"

"You stand for your daughter," David said, drawing his blade. "For the future. We'll stand for the past."

They were right. Vert knew they were right. But leaving them—

"GO!" Marcus roared, and Vert ran.

He heard Marcus laugh behind them—that wild, berserker laugh that had terrified enemies across many campaigns. David's voice rose in an old hymn about fallen heroes. Steel met steel.

Two riders had circled wide while eight engaged his friends. The lance took Elena in the side with textbook precision. She gasped, hands flying to her belly. The second rider's horse—its hoof came down with a wet sound that would haunt him forever.

"Elena!"

The world went sharp and clear and terrible. His hands moved without thought. The first rider died before he knew Vert had reached him. The second managed half a scream. Seconds of violence he'd barely remember later. Just blood and Elena's name and the horrible understanding that he was too late.

He looked up, past his dying wife, searching for the remaining attackers. The horsemen—the entire squad—had simply vanished. The sound of their hooves was gone, leaving only the corpses of Marcus and David, silent and still. Vert’s mind was too traumatized to register the impossible event.

Elena was still breathing when he reached her, barely.

"Th... ba...by," she whispered through blood.

He lifted his daughter from her open belly with hands that wouldn't stop shaking. Perfect except for the crushed skull. The brain matter leaking through. She'd never drawn a single breath.

Some desperate part of him couldn't accept it. He placed the baby back inside Elena's opened womb. If he could reach the medical tents, if there was a healer, if there was any magic in this godforsaken world—

He lifted Elena and walked toward Fort Kaelora. The city was burning now—complete consumption, not tactical. The screams carried across the distance. The air felt thick, sick, and whispering. Everywhere Vert looked, the chaos tried to take hold, tempting him toward a horror that made no sense. He shook his head, focusing on the pain in his arms, the only anchor he needed. A healer. He just needed to find a healer.

It didn't matter. Forward was the only direction left.

# Part III: The Weapon's Observation (One Week Earlier)

Designation: Gyouu. Classification: Guardian, Generation Seven. Purpose: Asset neutralization. Current status: Investigating behavioral anomaly.

Fort Kaelora represented significant deviation from baseline human parameters. Behavioral degradation timeline: Initiated 5.7 Chron-Units previous. Systematic cruelty for entertainment. Moral constraints abandoned. Causation: Exogenous Energy Signature detected.

Worth investigating. Perhaps terminating variables would yield data.

She infiltrated using refugee child protocols. Humans saw what they expected: a child, white skin, green eyes.

The orphanage maintained standard behavioral patterns. Immature humans playing, crying, seeking comfort. Specimen "Lily" approached with bonding intent.

"Want to be friends?"

Five years old. Trusting. Termination would require four Marks. Carotid compression. Her instructors had been specific about pressure points in juvenile specimens.

"Affirmative. Friendship parameters accepted," Gyouu responded. Slight modulation error. The specimen did not notice.

Four nights of observation yielded minimal data. Boredom parameters increasing. Perhaps terminating the specimens would generate emotional response in self.

She moved through the dormitory with trained precision. She executed twelve specimens using various methods to test for preference:

    Lily: Unconscious in one mark, terminated in four.

    Thomas who shared food: Cervical dislocation, 2.3 marks.

    Sarah who drew pictures: Cardiac puncture, instantaneous.

    Adam who sang: Suffocation, forty-eight marks to study struggle patterns.

Result: No emotional response detected. No satisfaction. No guilt. No variance from baseline emptiness.

Time since termination of final specimen: 4.38 MC. Still no emotional generation.

She catalogued the blood patterns, body cooling rates, facial expressions at moment of termination. All data. No feeling. Functioning as designed.

The caretaker found her at dawn, sitting among the corpses, taking notes.

"Why?" the woman screamed. "They were children!"

"So am I." Gyouu tilted her head, observing the caretaker's psychological state. "Physiological distress: extreme. Yet your reaction to this unit differs from reaction to terminated specimens. Interesting variance. Please elaborate on emotional distinction."

The caretaker fled. Soldiers arrived within the Major Cycle. She neutralized them with minimal effort. More came. She neutralized those. Eventually they applied combustion to the structure.

She remained inside, testing pain responses as flesh charred. The data proved insignificant.

# Part IV: Convergence

Fort Kaelora was eating itself alive.

Vert stumbled through streets that had become a nightmare. The baker from that morning—a man who’d smiled while serving bread six months ago—was now dissecting his wife in the street. A father showed his son the proper angle for cutting his own throat. Neighbors killed neighbors for sport.

This wasn’t war. This wasn’t even madness. This was something else, something that shouldn’t exist.

His legs were failing. Elena's weight seemed to double with each step. His daughter's tiny body pressed cold against his chest where he’d tucked her inside his gambeson. But he kept walking. One foot, then another.

He set Elena down gently against a wall, arranged her like she was sleeping, closed her eyes with trembling fingers. His daughter he kept close.

That’s when he saw her.

A child sitting beneath a collapsing building. White as bone, green eyes empty, completely still as death approached. Not trying to run. Not even afraid.

For one heartbeat, his mind slipped. That could be my daughter in eight years. If she’d lived. If there’d been a future.

The ceiling was already falling. No time to think. His body moved on instinct—the same instinct that had made him kill his commander, made him try to save those women, made him hold Elena even though she was already gone.

Save one innocent. Just one.

He dove forward as the structure came down.

# Part V: The First Curiosity

The human male's actions defied logical parameters.

Gyouu calculated force vectors. Termination in 2.4 Marks at current rate of collapse. Acceptable. She determined the most efficient data acquisition method was to test the subject's Structural Limit. Gyouu initiated Telekinesis to reduce the rubble mass by eighty-five percent, achieving the Structural Equilibrium of Vert's Max Force.

Yet he maintained position.

"Tactical value: zero," she stated. "Explain behavior."

Blood emerged from multiple points. Bones fractured in sequence—she counted each break. Organ compression exceeding survivable parameters. Should terminate within Major Cycles according to all models.

Six Major Cycles passed.

"I won’t let anything hurt you," he gasped through blood. "Daddy's here. I've got you."

Misidentification. He'd projected his offspring onto her. Psychological fracture creating false recognition. She should correct his error.

"Please," he whispered, body failing system by system. "Just let me save one. Just one."

And then it happened.

For 0.7 Marks, Gyouu experienced something unprecedented.

Not emotion—she lacked that architecture. But... curiosity. Investment in outcome. She wanted to know if he would succeed. Wanted to see what would happen next.

The sensation vanished, but the echo remained. In eight Chron-Units of existence, she had never cared about any outcome. Success or failure, life or death—all equally meaningless.

But for 0.7 Marks, she'd wanted something.

When his consciousness finally ceased, she acted.

# Part VI: Reconstruction

A wave of emerald energy radiated from Gyouu’s core, disintegrating surrounding debris in a controlled, expanding sphere. The air hissed as tonnes of splintered timber and shattered stone sublimated into inert dust.

    Time since curiosity event: 4 Cycles, 32 Marks.
    Threat neutralized. Subject Vert Vozaprime terminated.
    Yet, an echo of the subject's RF signature persists in local space. Query: Why?

She knelt beside the male. Her optical sensors performed a detailed scan, cataloging the damage with cold precision.

    Physical status: Critical. Spinal fractures at C4, C5, L2, L3. Widespread organ failure. Systemic compression trauma.
    Prognosis: Non-survivable by baseline human standards.
    Assessment: Damage is repairable.

Nanites, energized by her core, swarmed from her fingertips into his broken form. She rebuilt him with surgical accuracy. Bones were realigned and fused with synthesized calcium lattice. Organs were reconstructed molecule by molecule. Damaged neural pathways were purged of trauma and meticulously restored. She left only superficial burns—cosmetic damage to maintain a believable narrative for potential observers. The process required a significant expenditure of energy, a protocol deemed wasteful by any tactical measure.

    Time since curiosity event: 2 MC, 14 C. Decision to preserve subject: Illogical. No strategic value identified. Yet, the compulsion remains.

She had never wanted before. Eight chron-units of operational void, of pure logic and function, had been rewritten in the 0.7 marks he stood between her and the rubble.

This male had generated a persistent anomaly in her core programming. He was worth studying. Worth preserving.

Worth... keeping?

The query was a foreign concept, inefficient and undefined. She lifted his mass—considerable for her current frame—and moved toward the distant lights of the harbor. During transit, she modified her external appearance. A melanin injection darkened her skin. Her iris pigmentation was shifted to cerulean blue. Follicle structure was re-sequenced, turning her hair to spun silver. The result was a standard refugee profile. Optimal camouflage.

The merchant vessel reeked of human distress compounds—pheromonal excretions of fear, gastric acids, and the bacterial markers of infected wounds. She placed him among the other damaged specimens in the makeshift infirmary and initiated passive observation.

    Time since curiosity event: 14 Major Cycles.
    Anomaly has not recurred.
    And yet, the subject remains... significant.

# Part VII Eleven Days at Sea

The journey to the refugee port of Ruvian would take eleven days.

    Day three. 259,200 Marks since curiosity event. Anomaly has not repeated. Yet subject remains significant. Query: Why?

Gyouu had secured their passage through the precise application of force. The elderly merchant captain had been sleeping when  Gyouu approached. He woke to find a child's hand pressed against his throat. It was not squeezing—merely resting with terrible precision over his carotid artery.

"Query: Do you value your continued biological function?" her voice was flat, toneless. "Seventeen silver pieces and that blade. Quality steel. Or consciousness cessation in four Marks. Choose."

He tried to scream. Her other hand moved—barely a blur—and his voice died. She had applied pressure to his laryngeal nerve.

"Volume is unnecessary. Provide resources or accept termination. Three Marks remain."

She did not look strong enough to harm a cat, but when he hesitated, her fingers began to close—just slightly—and the world grayed at the edges. The child's emerald eyes watched him begin to suffocate with the same clinical interest one might afford a chemical reaction.

He frantically pointed at his purse and the sheathed sword hanging from his bedpost. She released him, taking the coins and blade with practiced efficiency before tilting her head.

"Gratitude for the transaction. Memory of this exchange: optional. Recommend deletion for continued operational health."

The cargo hold was packed with bodies—families pressed together, children crying, the sick retching into buckets that were rarely emptied. The air was thick with the smell of human distress compounds.

They had placed Vert with the other wounded in a corner, straw for bedding and nothing more. Three nurses—overwhelmed and exhausted—did what they could with what little they had.

"Poor thing," Nurse Catherine murmured on the second day, seeing Gyouu's unblinking vigil. "To have lost everything. Your father will recover, child."

Gyouu had perfected her thousand-yard stare. A traumatized child was a believable profile.

On the fourth day, Nurse Ada found Gyouu in a dim corner, several dead rats arranged in a precise formation before her. The child's fingers moved in intricate patterns in the air. The corpses twitched, danced, and performed elaborate maneuvers like tiny, grotesque soldiers.

"What are you doing?" Ada asked, her voice cautious.

Gyouu looked up, her eyes too old for her face. "Practicing necromantic manipulation. It is a boredom mitigation protocol."

The rats collapsed simultaneously into a still pile.

Ada retreated. Some things were better left unwitnessed on a ship with no escape.

    Day four. 345,600 Marks since curiosity event. Subject showing signs of imminent consciousness return. Preparing interaction protocols.

Each night, while he slept, she sent threads of green energy into his body. She rebuilt atrophied muscle tissue and reinforced his bone density with synthesized lattices. When he woke, he would be functional.

On the fifth day, Vert stirred. "Elena... Marcus... David... Sara..." His hand grasped at the air.

Gyouu observed his fingers closing on nothing. She analyzed the physiological markers of grief, this concept of 'missing someone.' She placed her small hand in his.

His fingers closed around hers, a reflex. His breathing regulated.

She remained in that position for six major cycles, studying the point of contact. His skin: warm, callused from swordwork. Hers: cool, unmarked. A temperature differential of 2.3 Thermal Units.

    432,000 Marks since curiosity event. Contact with subject is generating... a new data-state. Not curiosity. Different. Cataloguing.
# Part VIII: Awakening

Hunger hit Vert like a physical enemy—his stomach had moved past empty into a gnawing agony, a feeling that his own organs had begun digesting themselves.

The world swayed. No—he was swaying. Wood creaked. The scent of salt, tar, and rot filled his lungs. A ship. He was on a ship.

His hands shook so violently he could barely focus. His throat felt like he'd swallowed sand and glass, but the hunger was the worst of it—a desperate, clawing need that made him tremble like an addict.

"Consciousness restored. Good. Performance in preservation scenario: adequate. Immediate nutrient intake is required."

A child sat beside him, watching with eyes that were green—no, blue. Her hair was blonde—no, white. Something kept shifting, as if his vision couldn't properly resolve her image. This wasn't his daughter. His daughter was dead. Had never lived. This was the child from the rubble. The one who spoke like a strangely.

"Nutrients prepared." She produced a bowl of thin gruel—standard refugee rations. "Consumption speed recommendation: gradual. Subject's stomach capacity has diminished by forty-seven percent."

The gruel might have been sawdust and water, but his body reacted like a drowning man finding air—desperate, graceless, purely animal. The first spoonful burned going down, but he didn't care. He had never tasted anything so perfect.

"Decelerate ingestion," she stated, her tone flat. "Probability of nutrient ejection is rising."

He forced himself to slow, though every instinct screamed to devour it all.

"Query protocol," she said, tilting her head. "Designation?"

Between spoonfuls, memories surfaced—fragmented and terrible. "Vert. Vert Vozaprime."

"Acknowledged. Then this unit will be designated: Gyouu Vozaprime."

The words stopped his heart. This strange child, claiming his name. "You can't just—"

"You engaged in a preservation action on this unit's behalf," she interrupted, recalibrating her response. "You have a responsibility to see the outcome to its conclusion." She handed him a cup of water. He drank it too fast, coughed, then drank more.

"Duration of unconsciousness: five days. Journey duration to Ruvian: six additional days. Cover identity established: father-offspring unit, refugee classification. All material possessions: lost."

His stomach cramped. She produced a piece of hard bread and broke off a small portion. "Immerse in liquid prior to consumption. Digestive recovery requires a graduated introduction of solids."

He did as she commanded. It tasted like nothing and everything at once. "Where did you get food?"

"From the nurses. Nutrients were provided based on this unit's performance of acute trauma symptoms." She paused. "Additionally, seventeen silver pieces and a combat blade were acquired through aggressive negotiation with the vessel's merchant captain. Resources are sufficient for the initial survival period."

She'd robbed someone. This child had threatened and robbed a man while he slept.

"What are you?" he asked, his voice a rasp.

"Classification: Great Human. Purpose: Guardian. Current status: defective."

Great Human. The words should have terrified him. He’d heard the stories—monsters that looked like people, slaughterers. But he was too exhausted, too empty, too focused on not vomiting his first meal to process the fear. "Defective how?"

"This unit experienced 0.7 Marks of curiosity regarding your survival. It was an unprecedented investment in a non-critical outcome. A significant deviation from baseline parameters." She tilted her head again, a bird-like gesture of analysis. "Time since curiosity event: 432,047 Marks. No recurrence. Yet the compulsion to maintain your functionality persists. It is inexplicable."

He laughed—a broken, raw sound, but real. "That's not being defective. That's called growth."

"Incorrect. This unit is not capable of growth. Only function or malfunction."

Around them, the other refugees huddled in their misery. Children cried. Adults prayed in a dozen languages. The sick moaned. The dying rattled.

"Rest," Gyouu said, placing her small, cool hand over his scarred one. "Tomorrow, we continue."

Vert's fingers closed around hers—an unconscious gesture—and utter exhaustion pulled him back under. But this time, his stomach wasn't empty. It was a small victory, but it was a victory nonetheless.

Gyouu remained motionless, watching him breathe, counting his heartbeats, memorizing his respiratory patterns.

"Mine," she whispered, testing the word. It was a new variable, a new classification. "Yes. Analysis confirmed. This human: mine."

    Time since curiosity event: 432,240 Marks. The 0.7-Mark anomaly had rewritten eight Chron-Units of operational void. Unacceptable. Unexplainable.

    Undeniable.

    For the first time, Designation Gyouu had acquired something worth keeping. The subsequent operational directive would be to learn why.

# Chapter 2: What We Learn

# Part I: The Harbor Gates

The ship vomited its human cargo onto Ruvian's docks in a desperate rush.

Refugees pushed and shoved, families trying not to lose each other in the crush of bodies. The smell hit Vert worse than the crowd—fish rot, tar, and the sweat of hundreds of unwashed people pressed together under the rising sun. His legs shook with each step. Eleven days of ship's gruel hadn't been enough. His body felt like it belonged to someone else, someone actively dying. His knee buckled, and he would have fallen if not for Gyouu's hand on his elbow, a grip as unyielding as forged steel.

"PAPERS!" a guard bellowed at the gates ahead. "NO PAPERS, NO ENTRY!"

Most refugees had nothing. They begged, pleaded, and offered what little they'd hidden. Some tried to slip past in the confusion. The guards were ready for that—grabbing runners, throwing them to the cobblestones, the sound of iron shackles clicking shut.

"Please, my children are sick—" a woman cried.

"Back on the ship or into a cell. Choose."

Gyouu observed the chaos with clinical detachment.

"Guard approach vector: twelve degrees left," she murmured. "Distance: 4.3 Manitemeters. Interception probability: eighty-seven percent."

Vert didn't understand the mathematics, but he understood the guard pushing toward them—a man with a scarred face, dead eyes, and a cudgel already raised. Protective instinct flared, and Vert tried to step in front of Gyouu, only for his legs to nearly give out beneath him. He stumbled, a pathetic gesture of defense.

"You two. Papers."

Gyouu turned her full attention to the guard. Not her face—she kept that blank, a perfect mask of a traumatized child. But something else. A pressure that made the man's step falter.

    Time since curiosity event: 950,432 Marks. Current objective: preserve subject. Threat assessment: minimal.

She held his gaze with the thousand-yard stare she had perfected, but underneath it was a focused projection of will. It was not a look, but a broadcast of pure lethality that bypassed the guard’s conscious thought and triggered a primal dread in his hindbrain. The air around her felt suddenly thin and charged, vibrating with a contained power that felt fundamentally wrong.

The guard's cudgel lowered. His eyes slid away, seeking an easier target. "You—the runner! Stop!" He charged after some other unfortunate soul, leaving them forgotten.

"Threat neutralized via psychological pressure," Gyouu noted quietly. "Efficiency rating: optimal."

They passed through the gates into Ruvian proper.
# Part II: The Struggling City

Vert had to stop five times before they found lodging. Once to lean against a wall, trying not to vomit. Once to sit on a crate while the world stopped spinning. The third time, the scent of fresh bread from a baker’s stall hit him, and the aroma was a form of physical torture, making his stomach clench so violently he had to double over just to breathe, another two  times just trying to wade though the crowds.

The city was chaos—refugees everywhere, locals cursing them in a dozen languages. A Harmin merchant argued with a human woman over the price of bread. A pack of Lowjins scurried past, hissing at anyone who came too close. A Domani shopkeeper dumped a bucket of dirty water on refugees sleeping in his doorway.

"Inefficient method of subject dispersal," Gyouu noted quietly. "Liquid waste could be repurposed for greywater systems." A moment later, she added, "Economic pressure generating interspecies conflict. Population density is exceeding infrastructure by approximately 340 percent. Probability of social collapse is rising."

"Can you..." Vert steadied himself against another wall, breathing heavily. "Can you speak more simply? I don't understand you half the time."

She tilted her head. "Linguistic adjustment requested. Attempting simplification." There was a brief pause. "The city has too many people. They are becoming angry."

"Better," he managed.

They found the Merwench Inn down a side street—the fourth place they'd tried. The others had been full or had refused them on sight. The innkeeper was a human woman with the weary look of someone who'd given up caring about anything but coin.

"How much?" Vert asked.

She looked them over—the refugee clothes, the exhausted man, the strange pale child. "Three silver a night."

"The sign says one silver."

"For locals. Refugees pay three."

It was highway robbery, but Vert was too tired to argue, and Gyouu was already counting their coins.

"Acceptable," Gyouu said, placing three silver pieces on the counter. "Room. Now."

    Current resources: 14 silver remaining. Survival duration at current rate: 4.67 days.

The room was on the third floor—cramped, moldy, with two narrow beds that had straw-stuffed mattresses. Vert collapsed onto the nearest one without bothering to remove his boots.

"Food is required," Gyouu stated. "Your metabolic systems are consuming muscle tissue. A starvation cascade is imminent."

"I know. I can feel it." Every part of him ached with a deep, hollow hunger. "Can you find food?"

"Affirmative." She paused again, processing. "Yes. I will acquire nutrients."

    Time since curiosity event: 950,847 Marks. Subject is deteriorating. Maintenance priority: critical.

# Part III: The Baker and the Lesson

Gyouu located a bakery two streets over. The olfactory signature was strong; it would draw Vert once she had acquired the bread. The baker—a large human female with flour-dusted hands—regarded her with immediate suspicion.

"What do you want, refugee?"

"Bread acquisition. Your posted price of two copper per loaf appears optimal for—"

"We don't serve your kind." The baker turned, retrieved a bucket, and with practiced casualness, flung the contents at the doorway.

    External liquid application detected. Temperature: 298 Thermal Units. Contaminant analysis: biological, non-toxic.

Dirty wash water hit Gyouu across the chest and face, soaking her simple dress. The small bakery went silent.

"Liquid assault detected," Gyouu said, her voice flat. Her hand moved to the concealed blade strapped  to her leg with mechanical precision. "Response calculation: Subject mass is approximately 72 Managrams. Force required for jugular breach: 4.2 Managrams applied at a 35-degree angle. Alternatively, puncture of the femoral artery produces termination in 90 to 180 Marks..."

Every customer in the shop froze.

"She's... she's describing how to kill me," the baker whispered, backing away. "Like I'm livestock."

"That's not a child," a Harmin woman gasped, pulling her own children closer. "Children don't talk like that."

"Stress chemical saturation increasing by a factor of four," Gyouu noted, scanning the room. "Fear response: extreme across all subjects. Fascinating. A verbal threat assessment generates a stronger response than physical violence in this population sample."

The baker's voice went shrill. "She said CHEMICAL SATURATION! What child says something like that?!"

From outside, Vert's voice was strained. He'd followed her despite his exhaustion. "She's just scared! The war... she saw things..."

"That isn't war trauma," someone spat from the back. "That's something else wearing a child's face."

"GET OUT!" the baker screamed, grabbing a heavy rolling pin. "OUT! Demon child! Monster!"

They retreated, Gyouu still dripping, analyzing the interaction.

"Query," she said once they were away from the crowd. "Why did threatening termination generate a more potent fear response than the initial assault?"

"People fear what they don't understand," Vert said, leaning heavily against a wall. "And you... you don't sound scared, Gyouu. You sound like you're possessed. People can feel it's wrong."

She processed this for 4.3 Marks. "My linguistic patterns are suboptimal for social integration?"

"Yes. And stop talking about killing in... measurements. No numbers, no angles, no... managrams."

"Understood. Attempting greater simplification." She paused. "I sound wrong. I will try to sound right."

"Good. Keep practicing."

    Time since curiosity event: 951,234 Marks. Subject providing behavioral modification parameters. Logging for future integration.

# Part IV: The Predator's Hunt

They found food eventually—a Gojin merchant selling watery soup and hard bread from a cart. He didn't care who bought from him as long as their silver was real. It was still highway robbery, but Vert ate it like a feast.

    Current resources: 12 silver. Survival duration: 4 days.

It was afternoon when they separated. Vert needed to search for work, though he could barely stand. Gyouu stated she would "observe local behavioral patterns for integration purposes."

What she actually did was hunt.

She had identified the predator two hours prior—a Bowljin with patchy fur. His bag, which clinked with finger bones, was a secondary confirmation. The primary identifier was his gaze, which tracked Vert with a fixed, predatory focus she had cross-referenced from her internal database of apex carnivores. She had observed two other refugees follow him into alleys. None had emerged.

Serial predator. Termination: authorized by probability of subject targeting.

She followed at an optimal distance of 27 Manitemeters as he stalked Vert through the crowded merchant quarter. Her subject was examining work notices, speaking to shopkeepers, getting rejected everywhere for being foreign, injured, and weak.

Perfect prey.

The Bowljin made his approach as Vert entered an alley, seeking a shortcut back to the inn.

"Excuse me," the creature said, its voice deceptively helpful. "You look like you need work."
Part V: Dissociation

The Bowljin's claws on his chest triggered something older than thought.

Suddenly, Vert was watching from somewhere else as his body moved. The reversal from advanced combatives, week six of training. The throat crush they'd drilled until his hands did it without conscious input. Pressure here. Angle there. His consciousness floated above, observing. That's efficient, some distant part of his mind noted. The instructors would be pleased.

The positions reversed—the Bowljin was slammed against the wall now, Vert's hands finding the throat, squeezing with precise, brutal pressure. Far more than was needed.

When he came back to himself, the predator was a broken thing on the alley floor, and Vert's knuckles were split open and bleeding.

"No," he whispered, stumbling back. "No, no, not again—"

"Termination efficiency: 94th percentile," Gyouu announced from the alley's mouth. She had been observing the entire time. "Technique identified: Kellar military close-quarters protocol, variation three. Time to consciousness loss: 4.2 Marks. Time to termination: 11.8 Marks."

"I don't remember doing it!" Vert's voice cracked. "I killed him and I don't remember!" He slammed his broken fist into the brick wall. The pain was a grounding shock, and he did it again.

"Stop," Gyouu said, her head tilting in confusion. "You are damaging your primary weapon. Impact velocity against masonry risks metacarpal fracture. Inefficient."

"I'm becoming one of them! The soldiers I ran from!"

He moved to headbutt the wall, but Gyouu caught him, her small body an immovable object.

"Stop. Listen." She pointed at the corpse. "Examine his belongings."

With shaking hands, Vert searched the body. He found eight silver coins. And a leather bag containing twenty-three preserved human fingers, each labeled with a name and a date.

"Serial predator," Gyouu said simply. "You terminated a threat, preventing future loss of life."

"This doesn't make it right."

"No," she agreed. "But context matters. You humans are frequently recorded stating this."
