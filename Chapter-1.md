# Chapter 1, Part I: Under Stone

Six hours holding up rubble, and Vert couldn't feel his legs anymore.

The pressure wasn't just weight; it was a living, burning vise across his back where timber pressed through splintered stone. He tasted copper and ash. His lungs made a wet, tearing sound every time he tried to pull air in. But he held.

The child beneath him hadn't moved. Just watched him with those strange green eyes that never blinked, speaking in that flat voice that made his skin crawl even through the pain.

"Designation: Human-baseline, male. Age: Twenty-two Chron-Units. Status: Structural integrity failing by factor thirty-one." She paused, tilting her head. "Termination cascade initiated two Major Cycles past. Spinal integrity: declining. Yet: continuation. Anomaly logged. Fascinating."

By Leniha, what kind of child talks like that?

He tried to tell her to run, but blood came out instead of words. It sprayed across her white dress. She studied the arc with detached interest.

"Arterial spray trajectory: seventy-three degrees. Volume: approximately twelve Mililites. Systemic failure progressing within expected parameters." She looked up. "Termination sequence is no longer required."

He couldn't let go. He felt the conviction deep in his chest—that pure, cold sense of duty. He had to hold. You held the line. You saved the innocent.

Even when the innocent didn't seem to understand what being saved meant.

Elena.

God, Elena's face when the lance went in. The surprise in her eyes. Her hands flying to her belly, trying to protect—

No. Don't think about it. Just hold.

"Biological stress indicators spiking," the child announced, reaching up to touch his face with fingers cold as winter stone. "Heart rate: 142 BPM. Core temperature: dropping. Hypothesis: emotional distress accelerating metabolic failure."

The building groaned. More weight shifting. Everything going dark at the edges.

"You're... a child," he managed. The words came out garbled, but she seemed to process them instantly.

"Classification accepted. However, structural integrity of protective entity failing. Twenty Marks to complete architectural collapse. This unit possesses self-extraction capability. Query remains: Why continue?"

The child watched him die with those empty green eyes. No fear. No gratitude. Just... observation.

"Recording," she said quietly. "Recording everything."

# Part II: The Deserter's Choice (Twelve Hours Earlier)

The woman's screams had stopped. That was worse than when they'd started.

Vert Vozaprime stood in his commander's tent, sword still dripping blood onto expensive carpets. Two women huddled against tent poles, chained like animals, clothes torn, eyes empty. Used for sport. For entertainment.

Six months ago, this would have been unthinkable. His commander had been a hard man but honorable. Now he was dead on his own tent floor, wine cup still in hand.

"You've lost your mind, Vozaprime." Lieutenant Kress stepped over the body like it was furniture. "Killing a superior over some enemy whores?"

Vert felt the rage—not fear, but a searing, pure heat that pooled instantly in the center of his chest. The control that usually stopped him was no longer there. It was rage that felt like power.

"When did this start?" Vert’s voice shook, thick with moral horror. "When did we become this?"

"When winning became all that mattered." Kress drew his blade. "You know what happens to deserters."

The fight was brief. When Kress drew his blade, Vert’s body moved with an awful, mechanical finality. He slammed his blade into Kress’s guard with a blinding, uncontrolled surge of force. The impact overloaded Kress's arm instantly. A searing spike of acute pain shot up Vert's own shoulder as the recoil overflowed his center, but he ignored it. Kress lay screaming in his own blood.

Vert cut the women free with shaking hands. They shuffled away without looking at him, broken beyond thanks.

Marcus found him standing over Kress, then David. His sword-brothers from their first campaign, back when they'd believed the war had meaning.

"What the fuck," Marcus breathed, seeing the scene. "What have we become?"

"That's why I did it." Vert's hands wouldn't stop shaking. "This isn't war anymore. It's something else."

"Started six months back," David muttered, voice low. "First just the bar fights getting meaner. Then the whippings for no reason. Last month, the first torture for sport. This week..." He gestured at the tent. "This."

"Whole camp's mobilizing," Marcus said, no judgment in his voice. "Deserter hunters. We should—"

"Not we. Me." Vert wiped his blade clean. "This is my choice."

"Our choice," Marcus corrected. "We've avoided seeing for far too long already. Your wife?"

"Eastern gate."

They moved through the camp's shadows. Everywhere Vert looked, he saw horrors that hadn't existed six months ago. Soldiers torturing prisoners for entertainment. Officers placing bets on how long they’d last. Like something was poisoning them all, getting worse each day.

Elena waited with a supply wagon, seven months pregnant, steady despite everything.

"Thank God," she said when she saw him. "I thought you'd finally become like them."

"Never." He helped her onto the wagon. "We're getting out. All of us."

The sound of hooves made them turn. Ten riders with lances, torches turning their armor to flame.

"Go," Marcus ordered, already moving to position. "That's not a request, Captain."

"We stand together—"

"You stand for your daughter," David said, drawing his blade. "For the future. We'll stand for the past."

They were right. Vert knew they were right. But leaving them—

"GO!" Marcus roared, and Vert ran.

He heard Marcus laugh behind them—that wild, berserker laugh that had terrified enemies across many campaigns. David's voice rose in an old hymn about fallen heroes. Steel met steel.

Two riders had circled wide while eight engaged his friends. The lance took Elena in the side with textbook precision. She gasped, hands flying to her belly. The second rider's horse—its hoof came down with a wet sound that would haunt him forever.

"Elena!"

The world went sharp and clear and terrible. His hands moved without thought. The first rider died before he knew Vert had reached him. The second managed half a scream. Seconds of violence he'd barely remember later. Just blood and Elena's name and the horrible understanding that he was too late.

He looked up, past his dying wife, searching for the remaining attackers. The horsemen—the entire squad—had simply vanished. The sound of their hooves was gone, leaving only the corpses of Marcus and David, silent and still. Vert’s mind was too traumatized to register the impossible event.

Elena was still breathing when he reached her, barely.

"Th... ba...by," she whispered through blood.

He lifted his daughter from her open belly with hands that wouldn't stop shaking. Perfect except for the crushed skull. The brain matter leaking through. She'd never drawn a single breath.

Some desperate part of him couldn't accept it. He placed the baby back inside Elena's opened womb. If he could reach the medical tents, if there was a healer, if there was any magic in this godforsaken world—

He lifted Elena and walked toward Fort Kaelora. The city was burning now—complete consumption, not tactical. The screams carried across the distance. The air felt thick, sick, and whispering. Everywhere Vert looked, the chaos tried to take hold, tempting him toward a horror that made no sense. He shook his head, focusing on the pain in his arms, the only anchor he needed. A healer. He just needed to find a healer.

It didn't matter. Forward was the only direction left.
