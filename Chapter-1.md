Chapter 1, Part I: Under Stone

Six hours holding up rubble, and Vert couldn't feel his legs anymore.

The pressure wasn't just weight; it was a living, burning vise across his back where timber pressed through splintered stone. He tasted copper and ash. His lungs made a wet, tearing sound every time he tried to pull air in. But he held.

The child beneath him hadn't moved. Just watched him with those strange green eyes that never blinked, speaking in that flat voice that made his skin crawl even through the pain.

"Designation: Human-baseline, male. Age: Twenty-two rotations. Status: Structural integrity failing by factor thirty-one." She paused, tilting her head. "Termination cascade initiated two major cycles past. Spinal integrity: declining. Yet: continuation. Anomaly logged. Fascinating."

By Leniha, what kind of child talks like that?

He tried to tell her to run, but blood came out instead of words. It sprayed across her white dress. She studied the blood with detached interest.

"Arterial spray trajectory: seventy-three degrees. Volume: approximately twelve Mililites. Systemic failure progressing within expected parameters." She looked up. "Termination sequence is no longer required."

He couldn't let go. He felt the conviction deep in his chest—that pure, cold sense of duty. He had to hold. You held the line. You saved the innocent.

Even when the innocent didn't seem to understand what being saved meant.

Elena.

God, Elena's face when the lance went in. The surprise in her eyes. Her hands flying to her belly, trying to protect—

No. Don't think about it. Just hold.

Marcus laughing as the riders charged. David singing that old war hymn. They'd known they were going to die. They'd done it anyway so he could get Elena out, so their baby could have a chance, and it hadn't mattered because—

"Biological stress indicators spiking," the child announced, reaching up to touch his face with fingers cold as a corpse. "Heart rate: 142 BPM. Core temperature: dropping. Hypothesis: emotional distress accelerating metabolic failure."

The building groaned. More weight shifting. Everything going dark at the edges.

"You're... a child," he managed. The words came out garbled, but she seemed to process them instantly.

"Classification accepted. However, structural integrity of protective entity failing. Twenty marks to complete architectural collapse. This unit possesses self-extraction capability. Query remains: Why continue?"

This unit? What was wrong with her?

But he couldn't let go. Couldn't let another innocent die. Not after Elena. Not after their daughter who never got to breathe. If he let go now, if he stopped trying to save just one life, then what was the point of any of it?

The child watched him die with those empty green eyes. No fear. No gratitude. Just... observation.

"Recording," she said quietly. "Recording everything."
