Vozaprime Defensive Classification Index

Addendum A: Resonance Mitigation Classifications (RMC)

Author: Gyouu Vozaprime
Status: Theoretical Framework
Date of Composition: Post-Ruvian Escape (Day 14)

Part I: Addendum Rationale

The Vozaprime Kinetic Standard (VKS) is a baseline for assessing physical durability. It is a gross measurement, insufficient for classifying specialized threats. A high Kinetic Classification (e.g., C-3) does not imply a high resistance to other attack vectors. A C-3 Berserker could possess a C-0 Psychic defense, making it a "hard shell, soft mind" target—optimally neutralized via telepathic assault.

Therefore, a secondary classification system is required to analyze an entity's ability to mitigate non-kinetic, RF-based attacks.

Part II: RMC-T (Thermal Mitigation Classification)

This test quantifies a subject's ability to mitigate a focused, continuous-wave thermal-RF broadcast.

Test Standard: A 1-Mark, 1-square-centimeter beam of focused thermal energy.

Metric: Joules-per-second (Watts) withstood before structural integrity is compromised. (1 mana ≡ 3,000 Joules).

Classification T-0: Unshielded

Test: Failure to mitigate 3,000 J/s (1 mana/sec).

Analysis: Subject possesses no natural resistance or shielding. Skin and tissue suffer immediate, catastrophic burns.

Examples: Baseline humans (Professor Hendrick, Magnus).

Classification T-1: Resistant

Test: Can mitigate up to 30,000 J/s (10 mana/sec).

Analysis: Subject suffers pain and superficial burns but avoids critical structural failure. This implies an innate, passive resistance (e.g., thermal-adapted biology) or rudimentary magical shielding.

Examples: Asset Vert (due to thermal-lineage awakening).

Classification T-2: Shielded

Test: Can mitigate up to 300,000 J/s (100 mana/sec).

Analysis: Subject can actively and effectively nullify a significant thermal assault via proficient, dedicated magical shields.

Examples: Berserker "D" (projected).

Classification T-3: Absorbent

Test: Can mitigate up to 1,500,000 J/s (500 mana/sec).

Analysis: Subject's defenses are advanced, capable of absorbing or redirecting massive thermal loads.

Examples: Inquisitor "C", Gyouu Vozaprime.

Classification T-4: Immune

Test: Cannot be compromised by known thermal attack vectors.

Analysis: Subject's biology or technology (e.g., Sentient Alloy chassis) operates on a principle that renders thermal energy irrelevant.

Examples: The Tier-5 "Seeker."

Part III: RMC-P (Psychic Mitigation Classification)

This test quantifies a subject's ability to mitigate a direct telepathic or neural assault. This is the "instant kill" vector.

Test Standard: A 1-Mark, focused telepathic "shutdown" packet.

Metric: The mana-equivalent cost of the assault packet required to achieve cognitive failure.

Classification P-0: Unprotected

Test: Fails to mitigate a 0.1 mana "shutdown" packet.

Analysis: Mind is an open system with no defenses. Subject can be instantly rendered unconscious or terminated.

Examples: 99.9% of baseline humans (Professor Hendrick, Magnus, Lira).

Classification P-1: Disciplined

Test: Can mitigate a 1-mana "shutdown" packet.

Analysis: Subject has rudimentary mental discipline (e.g., meditation, military "iron will" training) that can resist a low-level probe or emotional manipulation, but will fail against a direct, focused assault.

Examples: Asset Vert (baseline), highly trained soldiers.

Classification P-2: Fortified

Test: Can mitigate a 50-mana "DDoS" assault packet.

Analysis: Subject possesses specialized mental shielding, either through innate psionic biology or advanced magical training. The mind is a hardened target.

Examples: Inquisitor "C" (confirmed).

Classification P-3: Labyrinthine

Test: Can mitigate and counter a 500+ mana assault packet.

Analysis: The mind is a fortress capable of repelling and actively harming a telepathic intruder. This level of defense is exceptionally rare.

Examples: Gyouu Vozaprime (via Multi-Mind architecture), The Twins (projected).

Classification P-4: Transcendent

Test: Cannot be interfaced with.

Analysis: Subject's consciousness is an unassailable, alien construct. A telepathic assault is analogous to a single-celled organism attempting to comprehend a star.

Examples: The Droth'sworn Empress (projected), the entity "Rar" (projected), the Tier-5 "Seeker" (AI, non-biological consciousness).
