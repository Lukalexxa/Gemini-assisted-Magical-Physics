RESONANCE FIELD: PURE PHYSICS ENGINE v2.5
Energy Calculation Framework for RF-Mediated Effects (Final Comprehensive Version)
DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document provides the definitive, complete framework for calculating minimum energy requirements for effects mediated by Resonance Field (RF). All principles adhere strictly to classical and quantum conservation laws.

Note: This document provides the absolute thermodynamic minimum. Real-world costs are higher due to biological inefficiency, structural stress, and latency, as defined in the Human Biology document.

1 mana≡3,000 Joules
TIER 1: CORE AXIOMS

    Conservation Laws (The Bedrock): All RF effects are subject to the conservation of Energy, Momentum, Charge, Baryon Number, and the constraint of increasing Entropy (Second Law).

    Oscillatory Coupling: RF couples to matter via oscillation, maximizing energy transfer at resonant frequency (ω=ω0​).

    RF Rectification: RF can be rectified to produce net static force (e.g., levitation), which requires continuous power input (Pstatic​).

    Propagation: RF propagates at c=3×108 m/s.

PART 2: CALCULATION FRAMEWORKS (Full Methodology)
FRAMEWORK 1: THERMAL MANIPULATION (Heating/Cooling)

Goal: Calculate Etotal​ based on temperature change, radiation loss, and conduction loss over duration t.

    Sensible Heat (Qheat​):
    Qheat​=m×c×(Tfinal​−Tinitial​)

    Radiation Loss Power (Prad​):
    Prad​=ϵ×σ×A×(Tfinal4​−Tambient4​)

    Conduction Loss Power (Pcond​):
    Pcond​=k×A×(ΔT/dchar​)

    Total Energy: Etotal​=Qheat​+(Prad​+Pcond​)×t

    Conversion: Mana=Etotal​/3,000

FRAMEWORK 2: PHASE CHANGES (Fusion, Vaporization)

Goal: Calculate energy for sequential phase changes (e.g., Ice → Water → Steam).

    Cool/Heat to Transition: Use Framework 1 (Q1​) to reach Ttransition​.

    Latent Heat of Change (Qphase​):
    Qphase​=m×L

    Total Energy: Sum all sensible heat terms and all phase change terms, plus any applicable losses (F1, Steps 2-4).

    Conversion: Mana=Etotal​/3,000

FRAMEWORK 3: KINETIC EFFECTS (Momentum/Impulse)

Goal: Calculate energy to accelerate mass (m) to velocity (v) in a brief impulse.
Ekinetic​=21​×m×v2
FRAMEWORK 4: SUSTAINED MOTION (Against Drag)

Goal: Calculate the power required to maintain velocity (v) against fluid drag.
Pdrag​=21​×ρ×v3×Cd​×A
PART 3: CRITICAL ENERGY CONSTRAINTS (Reference)

This section confirms necessary ratios for validity checks.

| Constraint | Rule | Rationale |
| Latent Heat Ratio | Cost(Freezing) must be>4×Cost(Heating) | Thermodynamics: Freezing requires massive energy removal (latent heat ≫ specific heat). |
| Transmutation Limit | Cost(Pb→Au)≈12.4 million mana/gram | Nuclear Physics: Transmutation is physically inaccessible due to the scale of nuclear binding energy. |
