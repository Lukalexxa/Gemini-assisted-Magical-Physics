Character Profile: Vert Vozaprime (V6.0)

The Anchor Anomaly, The Hybrid Sentinel

CRITICAL NOTE: Vert is the primary "Anomaly Source" for Gyouu's instability flaw—the human element that complicates her cold, logical programming. Once a baseline human soldier, he has been fundamentally transformed into a monstrous hybrid, and his core struggle is the schism between his fading humanity and his new, terrifying nature.

PART 1: ORIGINS & PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION

Vert's journey began as a human, but a desperate act of preservation by Gyouu has irrevocably altered his physiology.

1.1 Human Origins (Chapter 1)

|

| Trait | Description | Significance |
| Name | Vert Vozaprime | His human identity, linking him to a noble lineage (if unknown to him). |
| Background | Mercenary / Soldier | Experienced in combat, survival, and leadership; pragmatic but honorable. |
| Defining Trait | Unwavering Empathy | His capacity for selfless love and protection of Gyouu is the root of her "Anomaly." |
| Relationship | Gyouu's "Guardian" | Sees himself as Gyouu's protector, despite her vastly superior capabilities. |

1.2 The Hybrid Transformation (Chapter 6)

A catastrophic injury sustained during the Watcher attack forced Gyouu to perform an emergency, unauthorized "System Restore" by integrating Great Human biomechanical components into his dying body.

| Metric | Current Value (Post-Transformation) | Significance |
| Height | ≈6 ft 5 in | A significant physical growth, reflecting the larger Great Human skeletal structure. |
| Weight | ≈200 kg (Dense Muscle/Bone) | The sheer mass of the Great Human components. |
| Kinetic Output | ≈4,500 Managrams (kg) force | 3-4x his human maximum (~900 kg). This makes him capable of feats of immense strength but still far below a true Great Human combatant (e.g., Crimson Paragon: 50,000 kg). |
| Healing Factor | Minor (1.5x RW Baseline) | Accelerated cellular regeneration, but not truly superhuman. He still takes time to recover from severe injuries. |
| Sensory Acuity | Enhanced | Sharpened senses of sight, hearing, and smell, though not on par with Gyouu's constructs. |

PART 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE & INTERNAL CONFLICT

Vert's mind is now a battleground. He experiences a constant schism between his human emotions and the cold logic of the integrated "D" personality.

2.1 The Hybrid Mind

| Trait | Description | Impact |
| Human Psyche (Dominant, Fading) | Empathy, grief, honor, protectiveness. | His core identity, but under immense pressure. He struggles to reconcile his actions with his conscience. |
| "D" (Integrated Combat Specialist) | Cold logic, ruthless efficiency, tactical precision, detachment from emotion. | A co-pilot in his mind. "D" provides the raw, combat-optimized instincts. Vert must actively suppress it to retain his humanity. |
| The "Reboot" (Chapter 6) | Gyouu's psychic shutdown to halt PTSD symptoms after the Watcher attack. | Resulted in an unnatural, horrifying calm. His core emotions (grief for his family, guilt for his actions) have been temporarily suppressed, leaving him functional but empty. |
| Anchor for Gyouu | His constant, unwavering presence. | Paradoxically, his human "flaw" (empathy) is the critical data point that prevents Gyouu's logical systems from spiraling into destructive self-optimization. |

2.2 Current Psychological State (Chapter 7)

Emotional Flatline: He experiences a muted range of emotions. While he understands concepts like horror or anger, he feels them with a chilling detachment.

Functional, Not Free: He is highly effective in combat and tactical situations, but he often feels like a passenger in his own body, guided by Gyouu's directives and the instincts of "D."

Lingering Echoes: Despite the reboot, faint echoes of his human emotions persist, creating internal dissonance and foreshadowing a future struggle to reclaim himself.

PART 3: NEW ABILITIES & ROLES

Vert's new physiology has granted him enhanced capabilities, making him Gyouu's indispensable "Anchor" in the field.

| Ability | First Appearance | Description & Strategic Use |
| Direct Neural Interface | Chapter 4 | A bi-directional psychic link with Gyouu, allowing for complex communication, sensory sharing, and direct command input. |
| Enhanced Combat Prowess | Chapter 6 | His integrated Great Human components grant him superior strength, speed, and reflexes, making him a formidable, if still outmatched, combatant against supernatural threats. |
| Mana Resistance | Chapter 6 | His altered biology provides some inherent resistance to magic and psychic attacks, though he is not immune. |
| "Guardian" Role | Ongoing | Despite Gyouu's power, Vert's loyalty and his willingness to physically shield her make him her most vital, non-disposable asset. He now also physically carries the Professor. (Chapter 7) |
