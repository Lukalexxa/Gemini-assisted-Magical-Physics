# Chapter 2: What We Learn
# Part I: The Harbor Gates

The ship vomited its human cargo onto Ruvian's docks in a desperate rush.

Refugees pushed and shoved, families trying not to lose each other in the crush of bodies. The smell hit Vert worse than the crowd—fish rot, tar, and the sweat of hundreds of unwashed people pressed together under the rising sun. His legs shook with each step. Eleven days of ship's gruel hadn't been enough. His body felt like it belonged to someone else, someone actively dying. His knee buckled, and he would have fallen if not for Gyouu's hand on his elbow, a grip as unyielding as forged steel.

"PAPERS!" a guard bellowed at the gates ahead. "NO PAPERS, NO ENTRY!"

Most refugees had nothing. They begged, pleaded, and offered what little they'd hidden. Some tried to slip past in the confusion. The guards were ready for that—grabbing runners, throwing them to the cobblestones, the sound of iron shackles clicking shut.

"Please, my children are sick—" a woman cried.

"Back on the ship or into a cell. Choose."

Gyouu observed the chaos with clinical detachment.

"Guard approach vector: twelve degrees left," she murmured. "Distance: 4.3 Manitemeters. Interception probability: eighty-seven percent."

Vert didn't understand the mathematics, but he understood the guard pushing toward them—a man with a scarred face, dead eyes, and a cudgel already raised. Protective instinct flared, and Vert tried to step in front of Gyouu, only for his legs to nearly give out beneath him. He stumbled, a pathetic gesture of defense.

"You two. Papers."

Gyouu turned her full attention to the guard. Not her face—she kept that blank, a perfect mask of a traumatized child. But something else. A pressure that made the man's step falter.

    Time since curiosity event: 950,432 Marks. Current objective: preserve subject. Threat assessment: minimal.

She held his gaze with the thousand-yard stare she had perfected, but underneath it was a focused projection of will. It was not a look, but a broadcast of pure lethality that bypassed the guard’s conscious thought and triggered a primal dread in his hindbrain. The air around her felt suddenly thin and charged, vibrating with a contained power that felt fundamentally wrong.

The guard's cudgel lowered. His eyes slid away, seeking an easier target. "You—the runner! Stop!" He charged after some other unfortunate soul, leaving them forgotten.

"Threat neutralized via psychological pressure," Gyouu noted quietly. "Efficiency rating: optimal."

They passed through the gates into Ruvian proper.
# Part II: The Struggling City

Vert had to stop five times before they found lodging. Once to lean against a wall, trying not to vomit. Once to sit on a crate while the world stopped spinning. The third time, the scent of fresh bread from a baker’s stall hit him, and the aroma was a form of physical torture, making his stomach clench so violently he had to double over just to breathe, another two times just trying to wade through the crowds.

The city was chaos—refugees everywhere, locals cursing them in a dozen languages. A Harmin merchant argued with a human woman over the price of bread. A pack of Lowjins scurried past, hissing at anyone who came too close. A Domani shopkeeper dumped a bucket of dirty water on refugees sleeping in his doorway.

"Inefficient method of subject dispersal," Gyouu noted quietly. "Liquid waste could be repurposed for greywater systems." A moment later, she added, "Economic pressure generating interspecies conflict. Population density is exceeding infrastructure by approximately 340 percent. Probability of social collapse is rising."

"Can you..." Vert steadied himself against another wall, breathing heavily. "Can you speak more simply? I don't understand you half the time."

She tilted her head. "Linguistic adjustment requested. Attempting simplification." There was a brief pause. "The city has too many people. They are becoming angry."

"Better," he managed.

They found the Merwench Inn down a side street—the fourth place they'd tried. The others had been full or had refused them on sight. The innkeeper was a human woman with the weary look of someone who'd given up caring about anything but coin.

"How much?" Vert asked.

She looked them over—the refugee clothes, the exhausted man, the strange pale child. "Three silver a night."

"The sign says one silver."

"For locals. Refugees pay three."

It was highway robbery, but Vert was too tired to argue, and Gyouu was already counting their coins.

"Acceptable," Gyouu said, placing three silver pieces on the counter. "Room. Now."

    Current resources: 14 silver remaining. Survival duration at current rate: 4.67 days.

The room was on the third floor—cramped, moldy, with two narrow beds that had straw-stuffed mattresses. Vert collapsed onto the nearest one without bothering to remove his boots.

"Food is required," Gyouu stated. "Your metabolic systems are consuming muscle tissue. A starvation cascade is imminent."

"I know. I can feel it." Every part of him ached with a deep, hollow hunger. "Can you find food?"

"Affirmative." She paused again, processing. "Yes. I will acquire nutrients."

    Time since curiosity event: 950,847 Marks. Subject is deteriorating. Maintenance priority: critical.

# Part III: The Baker and the Lesson

Gyouu located a bakery two streets over. The olfactory signature was strong; it would draw Vert once she had acquired the bread. The baker—a large human female with flour-dusted hands—regarded her with immediate suspicion.

"What do you want, refugee?"

"Bread acquisition. Your posted price of two copper per loaf appears optimal for—"

"We don't serve your kind." The baker turned, retrieved a bucket, and with practiced casualness, flung the contents at the doorway.

    External liquid application detected. Temperature: 298 Thermal Units. Contaminant analysis: biological, non-toxic.

Dirty wash water hit Gyouu across the chest and face, soaking her simple dress. The small bakery went silent.

"Liquid assault detected," Gyouu said, her voice flat. Her hand moved to the concealed blade strapped to her leg with mechanical precision. "Response calculation: Subject mass is approximately 72 Managrams. Force required for jugular breach: 4.2 Managrams applied at a 35-degree angle. Alternatively, puncture of the femoral artery produces termination in 90 to 180 Marks..."

Every customer in the shop froze.

"She's... she's describing how to kill me," the baker whispered, backing away. "Like I'm livestock."

"That's not a child," a Harmin woman gasped, pulling her own children closer. "Children don't talk like that."

"Stress chemical saturation increasing by a factor of four," Gyouu noted, scanning the room. "Fear response: extreme across all subjects. Fascinating. A verbal threat assessment generates a stronger response than physical violence in this population sample."

The baker's voice went shrill. "She said CHEMICAL SATURATION! What child says something like that?!"

From outside, Vert's voice was strained. He'd followed her despite his exhaustion. "She's just scared! The war... she saw things..."

"That isn't war trauma," someone spat from the back. "That's something else wearing a child's face."

"GET OUT!" the baker screamed, grabbing a heavy rolling pin. "OUT! Demon child! Monster!"

They retreated, Gyouu still dripping, analyzing the interaction.

"Query," she said once they were away from the crowd. "Why did threatening termination generate a more potent fear response than the initial assault?"

"People fear what they don't understand," Vert said, leaning heavily against a wall. "And you... you don't sound scared, Gyouu. You sound like you're possessed. People can feel it's wrong."

She processed this for 4.3 Marks. "My linguistic patterns are suboptimal for social integration?"

"Yes. And stop talking about killing in... measurements. No numbers, no angles, no... managrams."

"Understood. Attempting greater simplification." She paused. "I sound wrong. I will try to sound right."

"Good. Keep practicing."

    Time since curiosity event: 951,234 Marks. Subject providing behavioral modification parameters. New directive: Optimal social integration requires suboptimal linguistic precision. Efficiency is secondary to perceived intent. This is a logical contradiction. Logging for future analysis.

# Part IV: The Predator's Hunt

They found food eventually—a Gojin merchant selling watery soup and hard bread from a cart. He didn't care who bought from him as long as their silver was real. It was still highway robbery, but Vert ate it like a feast, the first real warmth in his stomach in weeks. A few hours later, once the city's afternoon rhythms had settled, they separated. Vert needed to search for work, though he could barely stand. Gyouu stated she would "observe local behavioral patterns for integration purposes."

What she actually did was hunt.

She had identified the predator two hours prior—a Bowljin with patchy fur. His bag, which clinked with finger bones, was a secondary confirmation. The primary identifier was his gaze, which tracked Vert with a fixed, predatory focus she had cross-referenced from her internal database of apex carnivores. She had observed three other refugees follow him into alleys. None had emerged.

Serial predator. Termination: authorized by probability of subject targeting.

She followed at an optimal distance of 27 Manitemeters as he stalked Vert through the crowded merchant quarter. Her subject was examining work notices, speaking to shopkeepers, getting rejected everywhere for being foreign, injured, and weak.

Perfect prey.

The Bowljin made his approach as Vert entered an alley, seeking a shortcut back to the inn.

"Excuse me," the creature said, its voice deceptively helpful. "You look like you need work."
# Part V: Dissociation

The Bowljin's claws on his chest triggered something older than thought.

Suddenly, Vert was watching from somewhere else as his body moved. The reversal from advanced combatives, week six of training. The throat crush they'd drilled until his hands did it without conscious input. Pressure here. Angle there. His consciousness floated above, observing. That's efficient, some distant part of his mind noted. The instructors would be pleased.

The positions reversed—the Bowljin was slammed against the wall now, Vert's hands finding the throat, squeezing with precise, brutal pressure. Far more than was needed.

When he came back to himself, the predator was a broken thing on the alley floor. It wasn't the sight that broke him, but the sound—the wet, final noise of cartilage giving way. A sound he recognized from his training, from other alleys, other lives. It was the sound of his conditioning running perfectly. He stared down at his own hands, at knuckles split open and bleeding. They didn't feel like his. They felt like tools that someone else had just used.

"No," he whispered, stumbling back from the body and his own hands. "No, no, not again—"

"Termination efficiency: 94th percentile," Gyouu announced from the alley's mouth. She had been observing the entire time. "Technique identified: Kellar military close-quarters protocol, variation three. Time to consciousness loss: 4.2 Marks. Time to termination: 11.8 Marks."

"I don't remember doing it!" Vert's voice cracked. "I killed him and I don't remember!" He slammed his broken fist into the brick wall. The pain was a grounding shock, and he did it again.

"Stop," Gyouu said, her head tilting in confusion. "You are damaging your primary weapon. Impact velocity against masonry risks metacarpal fracture. Inefficient."

"I'm becoming one of them! The soldiers I ran from!"

He moved to headbutt the wall, but Gyouu caught him, her small body an immovable object.

"Stop. Listen." She pointed at the corpse. "Examine his belongings."

With shaking hands, Vert searched the body. He found eight silver coins. And a leather bag containing twenty-three preserved human fingers, each labeled with a name and a date.

"Serial predator," Gyouu said simply. "You terminated a threat, preventing future loss of life."

"This doesn't make it right."

"No," she agreed. "But context matters. You humans are frequently recorded stating this."

    Current resources: 20 silver. Survival duration: 6.67 days.
    Time since curiosity event: 952,156 Marks. Subject displaying acute moral distress despite tactical success. Human emotional responses remain incomprehensible.

Part VI: Night Observations

That night, while Vert slept fitfully, Gyouu stood at their window, studying her reflection and practicing.

She observed the refugees in the street below—how they walked with hunched shoulders, how they grouped in tight family units, how they spoke in brief, defensive tones. She logged the patterns.

Then she studied Vert. He mumbled in his sleep—"Elena," "Marcus," "I'm sorry"—and his hands moved, gesturing at ghosts. She memorized the motions. When he had been comfortable on the ship, telling stories, his hands had painted pictures in the air. Now, even unconscious, they moved with the echoes of his words.

She tried it. She lifted her hand while speaking aloud to her reflection: "The city has too many people."

No. Incorrect timing.

"The city—" hand rises "—has too many—" fingers spread "—people." Both hands fall.

Better. More human.

Vert shifted, a pained sound escaping his lips. She studied the way his breathing pattern changed, the micro-expressions of distress. When his nightmare peaked, she crossed the room and placed her hand on his forehead—a brief, cool touch.

His breathing eased almost instantly.

    Time since curiosity event: 977,356 Marks. Physical contact reduces subject's distress markers by 63%. Catalogued for future application.

She returned to the window, practicing expressions. Concern: pull eyebrows together. Sadness: corners of mouth down. Happiness: she could not yet replicate the required muscle configuration.

A drunk in the street below looked up and saw her in the window. Her attempt at a friendly smile made him stumble backward, muttering a prayer and signing against evil.

Still wrong. Still a weapon pretending at humanity. But Vert had said to keep practicing. So she would.

Mine to maintain. Mine to preserve. Mine to keep functional.

The possessiveness was not emotion—her architecture still lacked that capacity. It was a tactical directive. But when a woman at the inn had touched Vert's arm earlier, asking if he was alone, Gyouu had positioned herself between them. She did not understand the impulse, only that the woman needed to cease contact with her asset.

"Behavioral modification in progress," she whispered to her reflection. "Integration: attempting."

She tried the smile again. Still wrong. But marginally less wrong than before.

Progress.
# Part VII: Morning Lessons

Vert woke to find Gyouu sitting on the edge of his bed, watching him with those unblinking eyes.

"Duration of sleep: 7.4 Major Cycles. Nightmare frequency: twelve discrete events. Recovery rating: suboptimal but improving."

"Please don't count my nightmares," he groaned.

"Why? The data assists in tracking psychological recovery patterns."

"Because it's..." He sat up, wincing as his muscles protested. His hand was bandaged—she must have cleaned and wrapped it while he slept. "People don't count nightmares. It's weird."

"Weird," she tested the word. "Non-standard. Generating discomfort. Like my previous speech patterns."

"Exactly."

She tilted her head, processing. "I attempted behavioral mimicry during your sleep cycle. Observed refugee movement patterns. Practiced manual emphasis." She raised her hand awkwardly while speaking, slightly off-time. "Like this?"

Despite everything, Vert almost smiled. "You're copying me."

"You communicate with manual emphasis when your emotional state is positive. I am attempting integration."

"It's called talking with your hands. Lots of people do it."

"But you do it specifically when recalling positive memories. When telling stories about 'Marcus' and 'David' before they were terminated. When describing 'Elena's' laugh." She paused, her analysis precise. "Your hands stop moving when distress increases."

The observation was too accurate, too clinical. But also... she was trying. This strange weapon-child was genuinely trying to understand human expression.

"Keep practicing," he said softly. "But maybe... practice on me first. Before trying it on strangers."

"Acceptable." She stood, then attempted another new gesture—a hand on his shoulder. The pressure was wrong, too firm and clinical, but it was an attempt. "We should acquire nutrients. You require additional calories to facilitate tissue repair."

"Food. Just say 'food.'"

"Food," she repeated, nodding once. "I will attempt to purchase food without generating a fear response in the vendor."

"That would be a good start."

As they prepared to leave, Vert reached for the door handle. Gyouu's small body instantly moved to block him, her head turning to listen intently to the sounds in the hallway for 1.2 Marks before she stepped aside, a silent, automatic security scan. He should have been disturbed by the possessiveness.

Instead, he found it oddly comforting.

Someone—something—wanted him to survive. After losing everyone else, that was enough for now.

    Time since curiosity event: 1,006,156 Marks. Analysis: The 0.7-Mark anomaly is not a static event but an evolving subroutine. Subject's input is causing cascading modifications to core directives. The outcome is unpredictable. Designation for this process: Progress.
