GYOUU VOZAPRIME - COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTER PROFILE (V15.0)
The Guardian Anomaly: Strategic Synthesis & Ultimate Test Subject
CRITICAL NOTE:

Gyouu is designed to be a single-unit superior threat optimized for cognitive defense and massive Mana reserves. Her power is defined by her structural synthesis, designed to defeat threats far stronger than S-Rank. Her strength is focused on speed and complexity, not raw brute force.
PART 1: STRUCTURAL AND COGNITIVE SUPREMACY

Gyouu's unique profile is the result of applying ultimate engineered synthesis to create a structurally efficient, mobile defense platform.
1.1 Inherent Capacity and Ultimate Limits

|

| Metric | Value | Physics Rationale |
| Full Adult Max Cap | 6,000 mana (∼18.0 MJ) | Final projected reserve required to meet Anti-Apex defense demands. |
| Max Kinetic Output | 18,000 kg force (2.5× Great H-Monster) | Control Limit: Sufficient for mass control, but intentionally weaker than Red Lineage MAX (45,000 kg) to enforce reliance on magic. |
| Kinetic Reaction Time | 0.00001 ms (10 nanoseconds) | Absolute Structural Limit: The fastest physically possible reflex time for her exotic structure, required for Nanosecond Preemption against Mach 1+ threats. |
| Structural Repair Efficiency | MAX 32× RW Baseline | Fabrication Limit: The maximum structural recovery rate achievable by her specialized engineered tissues and RF allocation protocols. |
| Processing Latency | 0.0001 ms (100 nanoseconds) | CN Integration: External superconducting hardware bypasses the final bottleneck of organic latency. |
1.1.1 Droth'sworn Measurement Terminology (Gyouu's Language)

Gyouu's clinical speech utilizes quantifiable, engineered units for internal processing and external communication, replacing ambiguous human terms.

| Gyouu's Terminology | Human Equivalent | Scientific Rationale |
| Chron-Unit (CU) | 1 Year (Orbital Cycle) | Base unit for age and long-term planning (Chronometry). |
| Mark (M) | 1 second (s) | Base unit of duration (Derived from Aether Newt genetic timing). |
| Major Cycle (MC) | 1 hour (3,600 Marks) | Standard term for calculating hourly Mana budget. |
| Manitemeter (Mm) | 1 meter (m) | Base linear unit for distance and structural measurement. |
| Mililite (Ml) | 1 milliliter (mL) | Standard volume unit, used for precise fluid measurement. |
| Managram (Mg) | 1 kilogram (kg) | Base unit for structural mass and kinetic calculation. |
1.2 Physical Appearance and Transformation Status

Gyouu is currently an 8-year-old child undergoing an incomplete structural transformation, making her functional stats 60% of her adult MAX.

| Metric | Current Value (Age 8) | Adult Projected Value |
| Height | ≈3 ft 6 in  | ≈5 ft 10 in  |
| Weight | 72 kg (Dense Mass) | ≈120 kg |
| Mana Capacity (Current) | 480 mana (60% of max) | 6,000 mana |
| Hair/Eyes/Skin | Purple Hair/Eyes, Dark to Light Purple Skin | Reflects the aesthetic template of the Droth'sworn species. |
1.3 The Latent Memory Archive (DAI)

Gyouu's T-IQ and strategic brilliance are fueled by a massive, compressed database of 40 Elite Expertise Packets (DAI).

| Archive Content | Status | Tactical Impact |
| 40 Elite Expertise Packets | Active | The core database provides the tactical templates necessary to defeat any highly trained opponent (the source of her T-IQ≈450). |
| The Anomaly Source | Active | The specific emotional packets that maintain her instability flaw, serving as her Stabilization Point (Anchor). |
| Current Suppression | 1 Mind Cluster Active | Self-Imposed Limit: Gyouu actively runs a 25 mana/Major Cycle Suppression Drain to maintain a single, focused consciousness. |
PART 2: THE GUARDIAN PROTOCOL (RF STRATEGY)
2.1 Specialized RF Manipulation

Gyouu's magic is focused on high-precision, high-cost surgical strikes.

| Ability | Cost Rationale (Pure Physics) | Strategic Use |
| Termination Magic | Base Cost (∼100 - 150 mana/cast) plus minimal control overhead (∼2% of Cost). | Lethality and Incapacitation: Utilizes Tier 3 precision (Vascular Collapse, Neural Fracture) to bypass armor and cause immediate systemic failure. |
| Complexity Transfer | Required Cost (∼1,500 - 3,000 mana) | Multi-Target Defense: She dedicates 100% of the external Consciousness Node (CN) capacity to running simulations on targets, freeing her central brain for primary combat. |
| Necromancy | Cost derived from structural efficiency. | Her unique structural template allows her to utilize Death Energy with minimal energy dissipation, achieving the same effect as others with a lower gross mana expenditure. |
| Mass Phasing/Reduction | High Initial Cost (E scales with m) | Evasion: Allows her to instantly reduce her density for evasion, crucial for surviving supersonic attacks. |
2.2 Key Role Directives

| Directive | Rule | Context |
| Goal | Defeat threats far stronger than S-Rank. | Her profile is the structural defense layer for the entire Droth'sworn operation. |
| Strategy | Survive to gather information. | She risks physical damage but will not risk true death, prioritizing the extraction and preservation of unique data. |
| Mannerisms | Her speech remains clinical, using specific measurements (marks, managrams) that reflect her internal processing language. | Her psychological journey is one of learning human emotion while speaking the language of engineering. |
| Alien Signal | The Madness is Not Identified. | She knows the mass psychological decay was caused by a highly complex, powerful, Exogenous RF Signature she analyzed, but she is currently unaware of the identity ("Guusaf"). |
GYOUU VOZAPRIME - THE COMPLETE PROFILE

Gyouu is the ultimate structural defense, engineered to the absolute maximum of organic/synthetic efficiency, defined by her 0.00001 ms processing speed and her 6,000 mana reserve pool. Her ongoing conflict is between her flawless programming and the human curiosity that threatens to destabilize her purpose.
