# Character Profile: The Twins

### The God-Born Matriarchs of the Great Human Factions

**CRITICAL NOTE:** "The Twins" are not true siblings but are referred to as such due to their simultaneous, god-like birth from the "right and left hand" of the Invader God. They are Gyouu's creators and "faceless instructors." Their shared objective is the leadership of the Great Human factions and the execution of their father's will, but their methods, personalities, and domains are in direct opposition, creating a tense and often conflicting partnership.

### **Part I: Core Identity & The Duality of Command**

Born at the same moment from different mothers, The Twins represent the two core pillars of the Great Human military doctrine: absolute physical supremacy and overwhelming psychic/magical dominance.

### **Part II: Individual Profiles**

#### **The Crimson Paragon**
*The First Blade, The Matriarch of Ruin*



The Paragon is the inheritor of her mother's martial perfection and violent legacy. She is a warrior-goddess in her own right, a being who believes that any problem can be solved with the application of sufficient, perfectly executed force. She views strategy as the path to a fight, and magic as a tool to enhance physical combat. Her defeat at the hands of Rar during the Great War is a source of deep, burning shame, driving her to seek absolute physical superiority.

* **Abilities:**
    * **Kinetic Output:** Approx. **50,000 Managrams** of force, exceeding the standard "Red Lineage MAX" and making her one of the most physically powerful beings in existence.
    * **RF Biokinesis (Self-Enhancement):** Her "magic" is purely focused on overclocking her own physiology, allowing for explosive bursts of speed and reinforcing her body to withstand catastrophic impacts.
    * **Combat Mastery:** She possesses a perfect, innate understanding of every form of physical combat. To her, a fight is a mathematical equation she solves with violence.

#### **The Violet Sage**
*The Archon of Whispers, The Mind of the Void*



The Sage is the daughter of a reclusive and ancient empress, and she embodies her mother's preference for indirect control. She is a grandmaster strategist, a spymaster, and a psychic power on a scale that few can comprehend. She views direct physical confrontation as a clumsy failure of strategy. Her defeat at Rar's hands was not a source of shame, but a fascinating data pointâ€”an encounter with a chaotic, unpredictable variable that she has spent millennia analyzing.

* **Abilities:**
    * **Superior Telepathy:** Capable of high-level psychic warfare, including the creation of complex illusions, cognitive overrides, and direct neural assaults.
    * **RF Disruption & Manipulation:** A master of the `RF Engine`, she can unravel magical constructs, create reality-warping illusions, and manipulate the environment on a massive scale.
    * **Strategic Omniscience:** Through a vast network of spies, magical constructs, and psychic probes, she maintains a near-complete intelligence picture of all major world events.

### **Part III: The "Gyouu Project" - The Perfect Synthesis**

Gyouu was their joint creation, a secret and ambitious project to forge the ultimate weapon by synthesizing their two opposing doctrines into a single, perfect being.

* **Objective:** To create a weapon that possessed the Paragon's potential for physical perfection and combat prowess, combined with the Sage's capacity for hyper-intelligence and magical dominance. Gyouu was designed to be the best of both worlds.
* **The Flaw (The Anomaly):** Gyouu's development of an "illogical, protective bond" with a baseline human (Vert) is considered a catastrophic failure of the project.
    * **The Paragon's View:** She sees the anomaly as a disgusting weakness, a flaw in the weapon's design that must be purged through termination and reconditioning.
    * **The Sage's View:** She sees the anomaly as a fascinating, unprecedented psychological flaw. She is more interested in capturing Gyouu to *study* the anomaly, to understand how and why their perfect weapon "broke."
* **The Censorship:** They are the "faceless instructors." They deliberately and completely censored Gyouu's memories of them as a necessary security protocol, ensuring their ultimate weapon could never identify its own creators.

---

### **Part IV: Current Status & Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** Reclaim their rogue asset. The loss of a weapon as powerful and unique as Gyouu is an unacceptable strategic failure. They have dispatched their top assets (C, the Seeker) to retrieve her.
* **The Great War:** Their defeat at the hands of Rar and his allies during the Great War has defined their post-war strategy. It taught them that there are powers in the universe that can challenge them, instilling in them a degree of caution that belies their immense power.
* **The Hunt:** They are the unseen grandmasters moving the pieces on the board. While C and the Seeker are the immediate threats, The Twins are the true antagonists, the final bosses at the end of the game, and their objective is absolute: Gyouu will be brought back under their control, by any means necessary.
