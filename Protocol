0.17 NEW v4.0: Protocol Threshold Registry (ATJ)This registry contains all fixed, non-derived values used within the Protocol itself, complete with their mandatory external justification.

1.1.1 NEW v4.0: Data Granularity and Fidelity Check (GDFC)Purpose: Ensure calculations respect the non-linear and phase-dependent nature of real-world physical constants. Simple averaging is insufficient for high-rigor claims.MANDATORY CHECK RULES:Phase Transition Check: If a calculation spans a phase change (solid↔liquid↔gas), it must calculate energy using the correct specific heat (c) and density (ρ) for each phase. Using a single averaged c or ρ across phases is a FLAG.Large ΔT Check: If the temperature change (ΔT) exceeds 500 K (e.g., heating metal to melting point), the document must justify the specific heat value used, as c is non-linear at high temperatures.Acceptable: State an empirically derived caverage​ for the full range, or use a temperature-dependent formula.Unacceptable: Use room-temperature c (e.g., c293 K​) without justification.Radiation Fidelity Check: Any sustained thermal effect at T>500 K must account for radiative loss scaling with T4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law). Failure to include this T4 dependence for maintenance costs is a FLAG against realism.Kinetic Scaling Check: Any drag, friction, or pressure calculation must use v2 scaling and acknowledge the fluid density (ρ). Simplification to linear scaling is a FLAG.1.1.2 NEW v4.0: Counter-Intuitive Cost (CIC) CheckPurpose: Enforce thermodynamic realism by comparing the costs of common fantasy effects. This check guards against "narrative convenience costs."Cost Ratio Index (CRI)Physics BasisActionCRI-1: Latent Heat RatioCost(Heat 1 kg 50∘C)Cost(Freeze 1 kg)​Must be >4:1. Freezing requires removing latent heat (massive energy) + fighting entropy. FLAG if cost is less than 4× simple heating cost.CRI-2: Density IndexCost(Kinetic 1 m3 Air)Cost(Kinetic 1 m3 Water)​Must be >800:1. Water is approximately 833× denser than air. Manipulating large volumes of water must be proportionally more expensive than air.CRI-3: Static Force IndexCost(Kinetic 1 kg at 1 m/s)Cost(Sustain 1 kg for 1 hour)​Sustained Cost must be lower. The power cost of rectification (Framework 10) must be lower than generating initial kinetic energy. FLAG if continuous holding cost is equal to or higher than the initial kinetic impulse.CRI-4: Transmutation CheckCost(Transmutation 1 g) vs Cost(All Human Mana)If transmuting 1 g of common elements costs <1,000 human mana pools, it is a CRITICAL STOP (Nuclear physics violation).1.3.1 Show Your Work EnforcerMANDATORY RULE: EVERY calculation must show the derivation for its specific claim.1.

ROOT CLAIM: Boiling 1kg water costs 112 mana.

VIOLATIONS FOUND:
1. Pass 13 (Math): Calculation error in Step 3 (Used 25,000 J/mana instead of 3,000 J/mana).
2. Pass 23 (Guesswork): No derivation for latent heat of vaporization used.
3. Pass 35 (Consistency): Cost in Appendix A lists 139 mana (Contradiction with Claim).

ACTION: Fix Claim 4.1.B before continuing. (Fixing the Mana/Joule conversion will resolve all three violations.)
