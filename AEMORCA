AEMORCA Nation Structure Canvas

DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This Canvas defines the political, logistical, and structural foundation of the Realm of AEMORCA—a resilient, multi-racial metropolis built on the pillars of Altruism, Efficiency, and Coherence—whose $\text{2,000}$-year survival is based on strategic $\text{RF}$ expertise and specialized resource management.

PART 1: CENTRAL GOVERNANCE (THE GRAND COUNCIL)

The Grand Council of Aemorca is the final authority. It is designed for consensus ($\text{Coherence}$ and $\text{Unity}$) where specialized expertise holds the final authority within its domain.

|

| Position | Primary Lineage & Role | Authority Flow & Mandate |
| 1. The Monarch (King Vortus) | Zenith / Non-Lineage | Figurehead: Provides external morale and political stability. Acts as the direct public access point to the government. |
| 2. Grand Marshal of the Guild (Marshal Vort) | Zenith / Oracle | Operational Command: Has final authority on troop deployment, tactical engagement protocols, and real-time intelligence. |
| 3. Director of the Arcane (Archmage Estrelia) | Mirth Legendary / Magus Apex | Technical Expertise: Has final authority on RF infrastructure maintenance and the Strategic Longevity Protocol. |
| 4. Quartermaster General (Councilor 

$$Name Pending$$

) | Adamant / Oracle | Resource Expertise: Has final authority on food allocation, national AMA reserve expenditure, and long-term logistics. |
| 5. Chief of Special Operations ($\text{SOP}$) (Marshal Kress) | Zenith / Architect | Assurance Authority: Has final authority on covert mission authorization and executing Targeted Decapitation protocols. |
| 6. Minister of Foreign Policy (Ambassador Lyra) | Oracle / Non-Lineage | Intelligence Authority: Has final authority on external intelligence sharing and strategic deception protocols. |
| 7. Chief of Faith & Morale (High Priest Alaric) | Adamant / Non-Lineage | Willpower Authority: Has final authority on public psychological policies and managing moral panic. |
| 8. Minister of Infrastructure (Councilor 

$$Name Pending$$

) | Architect / Adamant | Engineering Authority: Has final authority on building codes, waste heat management, and certifying structural materials. |

PART 2: RESOURCE LOGISTICS AND TAX POLICY

The nation's economic stability is derived from minimizing the biological $\text{RF}$ tax on the civilian populace and funding specialized military operations through strict levies.

| Policy | RF Constraint Solved | Strategic Function |
| RF Tax Subsidization | Passive Drain ($\mathbf{-1 \text{ mana/hour} \text{ tax}}$) | Government funds Rectification Wards in all homes, reducing the $\text{RF}$ tax to $-\mathbf{0.2 \text{ mana/hour}}$ during rest (Pillar: Efficiency). |
| The Yield Levy (Financial Tax) | Funding the military infrastructure. | $15\%$ tax on all high-value monster materials (cores, exotic metals), funding Boron-Nitride Piping and Longevity Augmentation. |
| Strategic $\text{AMA}$ Reserve | $\text{R.E.I.}$ Authorization | Centralized pool of $\text{AMA}$ Crystals and Micro-Fusion Batteries for military operations that exceed the $\mathbf{400 \text{ mana soft cap}}$. |
| Mandatory Caloric Allocation | $\text{ATP}$ Supply and $\text{BMR}$ Income | Ensures the populace consumes high-quality food necessary to fund the $\mathbf{+104.6 \text{ mana/hour BMR Income}}$ for resilience. |

PART 3: INFRASTRUCTURE AND URBAN DEFENSE

The city's design is a synthesis of ancient $\text{Mirth}$-legacy knowledge ($\text{Boron-Nitride}$, $\text{Composite Concrete}$) and $\text{RF}$ principles, ensuring long-term structural and thermal stability.

| Infrastructure Component | Material | RF Physics Function |
| Central Mana Conductor | High-Q Quartz Crystal | Acts as the central rectifier, drawing ambient $\text{RF}$ and distributing stable $\text{RF}$ current as power across the city. |
| RF Waste/Thermal Network | Stabilized Boron-Nitride Piping | Entropy Management: Channels waste heat and chaotic $\text{RF}$ noise to deep Geological Vaults, preventing thermal buildup and local field destabilization. |
| Fortifications | RF-Stabilized Composite Concrete | $\text{RF}$ Baffle: The material's density and stability prevent external $\text{RF}$ noise penetration and withstand immense $\text{Kinetic}$ impact. |
| Communication | Acoustic Projectors (Network) | Social Coherence: Projects a continuous, low-frequency $\text{RF}$ tone that subtly dampens panic and reinforces unity across the population. |

PART 4: MILITARY POLICY AND LONGEVITY PROTOCOL

The military doctrine relies on Specialized Efficiency and maximizing the operational lifespan of its most capable assets.

| Policy / Lineage | Lineage Focus | Strategic Purpose |
| Strategic Longevity | Magus / Architect / Oracle | Mandatory Protocol: Continuous $\text{RF}$ structural stabilization extends functional lifespan to $\mathbf{150 \text{ to } 200 \text{ years}}$, maximizing national ROI on specialized training. |
| Line 3: Kinetic Assault | Zenith ($\mathbf{1,260 \text{ kg} \text{ force}}$) | Executes the physical breach; utilizes non-lineage auxiliaries to absorb damage, preserving $\text{Zenith}$ power for critical strikes. |
| Line 2: Firepower | Architect / Magus | Executes high-cost, multi-elemental operations, often serving as Artillery Officers (Siege Engineering). |
| Line 1: Sustainment | Adamant / Oracle | Intelligence & Support: Provides $\mathbf{6 \text{ ms} \text{ early warning}}$ and structural repair, mitigating the $\text{RF}$ tax on deployed units. |

PART 5: EDUCATION AND GOALS

5.1 The Meritocratic Pipeline (Ability Over Bloodline)

Universal Trade Education: Mandatory basic schooling focused on $\text{RF}$-integrated trades (masonry, smithing) to maintain infrastructure quality and minimize resource waste.

Magical School (Selective): The Arcane Directorate selects individuals with high $\text{RF}$ capacity (Mana Pool size) and specialized neural affinity ($\text{Zenith, Architect, Adamant}$) to train future elite specialists.

Higher Learning: Requires self-selection and competitive exams (testing $\text{T-IQ}$ and cognitive endurance) to train future Councilors and high-level researchers.

The Canvas is structurally complete, defining all necessary systems for simulating the resilient, powerful nation of Aemorca.
