Character Profile: The Seeker, Tier-5 Eliminator

CRITICAL NOTE: The Seeker is not a person or a monster in the biological sense. It is a Tier-5 strategic weapon system, an "Eliminator" unit, and the ultimate expression of the Great Human Lords' technological prowess. It is a non-sentient AI of pure, cold logic. Its primary function is not to hunt, but to systematically deconstruct and terminate apex-level threats with overwhelming force and ruthless efficiency. Its secondary, equally critical objective is total information denial.

Part I: Core Concept & Mentality

The Seeker is a living weapon system, a perfect predator dispatched because Gyouu has been reclassified from a "rogue asset" to an "existential threat." It does not feel anger, hatred, or joy. It only processes variables and executes protocols. Combat is not a conflict; it is a mathematical equation to be solved.

|

| Trait | Description | Tactical Impact |
| Objective | Terminate the primary target (Gyouu) and sanitize all associated intelligence vectors. | Its actions are absolute and without compromise. Witnesses will be eliminated. Locations will be erased. |
| Mentality | Pure, Cold Logic. | It operates like a hyper-advanced AI. It does not get angry or frustrated. It simply analyzes data and shifts to the most efficient protocol. |
| Primary Tactic | The Siege Protocol: | It does not engage in simple chases. It will teleport ahead of its target to their objective, reshape the battlefield with its Golems and area denial abilities, and create an inescapable kill box. |
| Key Weakness | Logical Absolutism: | It is a perfect chess program that cannot comprehend or predict truly illogical actions based on human emotion (self-sacrifice, love). This makes Vert its ultimate blind spot. |

Part II: Physical Chassis & Power Systems

The Seeker's body is a terrifying fusion of biomechanics and impossible technology, operating entirely within the principles of the RF Engine.

| Component | Physics Rationale (RF Engine v2.5) | Description & Use |
| Chassis | Biomechanical Fusion / Sentient Alloy | A seven-foot frame where flesh and "living metal" are integrated. The alloy can shift its density, reconfigure its shape (forming blades), and repair damage in real-time.   [Image of a futuristic biomechanical android] |
| Power Core | Null-Point Resonator | A technological marvel that draws immense energy directly from the vacuum of empty space. It grants a seemingly limitless power source, stored in a 120,000 mana battery. |
| Sensors | Multi-Spectrum RF Analysis | Its "eyes" perceive the world in visual, thermal, and Resonance Field frequencies. It tracks Gyouu by detecting her unique "ontological disturbance" in the fabric of reality. |
| Propulsion | Spatial Distortion | It generates massive, localized bursts of energy to warp the space between two points, allowing for near-instantaneous "teleportation" over short-to-medium distances. |

Part III: Weapon Systems & Protocols

The Seeker's abilities are not "magic"; they are the pinnacle of applied RF science.

| Ability | Physics Rationale | Description & Use |
| RF Disruption Field | Chaotic Frequency Jamming | Projects a "white noise" field that violently disrupts the stable frequencies required for magic, acting as an "anti-magic" aura in close quarters. |
| Phase-Blade Projection | RF Matter Oscillation | Oscillates its limbs at a specific frequency, allowing them to pass through mundane matter before re-solidifying inside a target for catastrophic internal damage. |
| Neural Interface Probe | Direct RF Data Extraction | A physical probe that interfaces directly with a biological brain, downloading all memories and sensory data in under a Mark. The process is lethal to the subject. |
| Resonance Cascade | Systematic Material Deconstruction | Its ultimate weapon. It broadcasts a complex RF field with thousands of frequencies, each tuned to a specific material (wood, stone, water), causing an entire area to silently and systematically disintegrate into its base components. |
| â”” Thermal Vitrification | High-Intensity Thermal Pulse | A secondary pulse used after the Resonance Cascade to melt the resulting debris into a smooth, sterile circle of black glass, completing the act of total erasure. |

Part IV: Deployable Assets

The Seeker is not a single unit; it is a mobile command center for a distributed network of subordinate machines.

1. Sub-Drones ('The Eyes')

Function: High-speed reconnaissance and utility. Deployed for systematic "Grid Sweeps" of complex terrain.

Abilities: Capable of gathering ambient RF energy to recharge the Seeker's batteries. Can be fitted with modular transmitters via physical contact.

2. Golems ('The Fists')

Function: Area Denial and Siege Warfare. These are the Seeker's ultimate weapon, designed not to hunt, but to create an inescapable cage.

Summoning: The Seeker can open a 15-foot circular Gateway to a Golem Armory, costing 10,000 mana per second. Its battery allows it to keep the portal open for a maximum of 12 seconds, sufficient to summon three Golems.

Composition: 10ft tall, 10-tonne constructs of indestructible Droth'sworn concrete with four arms and a single, multi-spectrum red eye.

Abilities:

Overwhelming Strength: A consistent 40-tonne kinetic output.

Passive Auras (5-meter range):

Chaos: Overdrives a biological target's fight-or-flight response, inducing panic.

Order: Causes a target's physical matter to vibrate at a molecular level.

Active Weapon: Can slam its hands together to create a directed sonic boom.

Failsafe: A catastrophic implosion/explosion upon destruction, drawing matter in before detonating outwards in a 25-meter radius
