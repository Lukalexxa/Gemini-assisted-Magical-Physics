HUMAN BIOLOGY: PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS (V4.0)
The RF-Evolved Human and the Limits of Organic Power

This document establishes the universal biological structure and energy constraints of the RF-Evolved Human (Homo sapiens), defining the physiological baseline for all populations in the Age of Might.
Part 1: Universal Energy Budget and Constraints

The entire human RF system is limited by the thermodynamic and chemical capacity of the neural and metabolic tissue.
1.1 Mana Capacity and Throughput Limits

The capacity is a fixed limit based on maximum safe ATP throughput and neural tissue thermal tolerance.

|

| Constraint | Value | Physics Derivation |
| RF Unit Conversion | 1 mana≡3,000 Joules | Macroscopic grounding: 300 kg×9.8 m/s2×1 m≈1 mana |
| Mana Capacity (EMAX​) | 100 mana units | The Biological Soft Cap: Maximum safe immediate ATP reserve (∼300 kJ) before metabolic failure. |
| Max Frequency Limit | 1015 Hz | The physical thermal limit of carbon-based neural tissue. |
1.2 Basal Metabolic Income and RF Tax

The body's energy consumption is managed by the Adaptive Neural Management (ANM) system, which balances the constant inflow of energy from food against the required operational costs.

| Energy Flow | Rate (Mana/hour) | Function / Policy |
| BMR Income (Food Metabolism) | +104.6 mana/hour | Constant influx from calorie conversion (∼1,800 kcal/day). |
| Passive Drain (RF Tax) | −1.0 mana/hour | Fixed Evolutionary Cost: Mandatory energy required to maintain the RF structures and defense field at baseline. |
| Optimal Recovery Rate | ∼10 units/hour | The limited rate at which the Mana Pool can safely absorb the BMR surplus without inducing thermal damage (the charging speed limit). |

Note on ANM: This system automatically reduces the Passive Drain to 0.2 to 0.5 mana/hour during deep rest or predictable low-stress periods (Optimized Idle Mode), conserving resources for the individual.
Part 2: Evolved Systemic Hardware

8 million years of RF pressure has resulted in the systemic modification of major organs to support energy throughput and stability.
2.1 The Neural and Kinetic Circuitry

These structures manage RF input, output, and high-speed energy transfer:

| Structure | Location | Physics Function | Universal Impact |
| Projection Cortex | Prefrontal Cortex | The Transmitter: Generates and amplifies coherent RF output patterns (Source of active casting). | Defines the 100 mana MAX and 1015 Hz frequency limit. |
| Somatic RF Conduits | Fascia/Tendon Layers | Kinetic Circuitry: High Q-factor protein filaments that act as superconducting pathways, channeling RF energy to muscles at near-light speed. | Enables the 0.2 second muscle reset and is the source of the Momentum Surge. |
| Core Energy Reservoir | Solar Plexus | The Kinetic Capacitor: Specialized organ that stores and instantaneously discharges rectified RF energy, bypassing neural latency. | Source of the Burst Acceleration advantage and primary buffer for RF energy. |
2.2 The Circulatory and Filtration System

These organs evolved to manage the extreme metabolic and thermal demands of instantaneous RF use.

| Structure | Location | Physics Function | Universal Impact |
| Heart (Myocardial Sheath) | Cardiac Muscle | High-Amplitude Pumping: Specialized RF protein sheath allows the heart to withstand the massive internal pressure spikes from instantaneous RF discharge (Kinetic Impulse). | Grants superior resilience against blunt force trauma. |
| Liver (Hyper-Mitochondrial Filter) | Hepatic Tissue | Instant Waste Clearance: Augmented mitochondrial density clears ATP waste and lactic acid from the bloodstream at an accelerated rate post-mana discharge. | Speeds physical recovery and restores Rectification efficiency. |
| Blood (Mana-Infused Matrix) | Circulatory System | Hyper-Efficient ATP Delivery: Plasma and cells optimized for rapid oxygen and ATP transfer to neural tissue. | Physical mechanism behind 2x to 3x faster healing. |
Part 3: Performance, Debilitation, and Limits
3.1 Universal Performance Baseline

All RF-Evolved Humans possess inherent physical advantages over real-world humans due to systemic RF optimization (Zenith Lineage values are listed for comparison as the practical MAX).

| Performance Metric | Universal Baseline | Zenith Lineage (MAX) | Physics Basis |
| Max Strength | 1.2x to 1.3x RW max | ∼1.8x RW max | Enhanced ATP coordination via Somatic Conduits. |
| Healing Rate | 2x to 3x faster than RW | 4x to 5x faster | Optimized ATP mobilization and waste clearance. |
| Kinetic Reaction | ≈100 ms (Nervous System) | ≈10 ms to 20 ms | RF sensing is 5x to 10x faster than visual/auditory processing. |
3.2 The Universal Complexity Ceiling (Limit of Control)

The biological limit on the number of stable patterns the neural network can maintain at once.
Complexity Ceiling=1024 RF Processing Clusters

| Complexity Tier | Example Material | Maximum Volume Equivalent (RFMAX​) |
| Tier 1: Simple (Kinetic) | Air, Steam | 50 to 100 Liters (∼1 kg of air) |
| Tier 2: Medium (Molecular) | Liquid Water, Stone, Iron | 5 to 10 Liters (∼5 to 10 kg) |
| Tier 3: High (Biological) | Living Tissue, Complex Proteins | 1 to 2 Liters (∼1 to 2 kg) |
3.3 Failure and Debilitation System

Consequences for exceeding limits are systemic and tied to RF hardware failure.

| Failure Mode | Mechanism / Trigger | Manifestation |
| Coherence Debt | Rapidly channeling 100 mana (or more via Surge). | "The Hummer" Pain: Acute, debilitating pressure in the skull (T4 thermal warning). |
| Pattern Failure | Exceeding the 1024 Complexity Ceiling. | Backlash/Seizure: Released chaotic RF energy channels back into neural pathways, causing systemic trauma. |
| Conduits Overload (Zenith) | Pushing the Somatic Conduits beyond safe kinetic throughput. | Acute Localized Pain/Paralysis: Conduits overheat, causing immediate muscle spasms and loss of kinetic advantage (≈1.0 second rest time). |
| Hardship Atrophy | Chronic malnutrition/stress during formative years. | Permanently Stunted MAX Capacity (50 to 70 units) and suppressed healing rates. |
Part 4: Universal Technology Integration

Technology exists to safely bridge the gap between human biological limits and high-cost RF effects. These tools are universally adopted (55%+ knowledge).

| Technology | RF Structure Enhanced | Physics Function |
| Ambient Mana Accumulator (AMA) | Core Energy Reservoir | External Reserve Battery: Uses high Q-factor crystals to passively collect diffuse ambient RF (slow charge ∼0.5 mana/hour), bypassing the 100 mana limit via instant discharge. |
| The Resonance Splint | Resonance Nodes | Healing Pattern Stabilizer: External crystalline structures maintain the cellular repair pattern, reducing the energy cost of healing by 40% to 60% and speeding recovery. |
| The Rectification Ward | Resonance Nodes / Sensory Cortex | Tax Reduction: Simple geometric patterns applied to resting areas stabilize local RF noise, reducing the Passive Drain to 0.2 mana/hour and conserving resources. |
| Kinetic Bracing Tool | Somatic RF Conduits | Recoil Dampener: Tools designed to spread the massive kinetic recoil of an RF discharge across the core structure, preventing physical injury during heavy lifting or strikes. |
Part 5: Genetic Specialization (The Lineages)

The specialized RF hardware of the Gilded Lineages is the result of 10,000 years of selective breeding, creating predictable aristocratic archetypes defined by their RF focus.

| Lineage | Archetype Focus | Dominant Structure | Primary Benefit |
| Zenith | Kinetic (Warrior) | Projection Cortex / Somatic Conduits | 10 ms Reaction Time and 0.2 sec Swing Recovery. Optimized for physical offense. |
| Architect | Throughput (Caster) | Projection Cortex / Thermal Shunt | 45 units/hour Recovery Rate and 15 L Complexity Ceiling. Optimized for sustained high-cost magic. |
| Oracle | Sensing (Spy/Advisor) | Sensory Cortex / Neural Filter | 1 km Sensing Range and Maximum Living Resistance (200 units). Optimized for defense and intelligence. |

This concludes the complete physiological blueprint for the RF-Evolved Human.
