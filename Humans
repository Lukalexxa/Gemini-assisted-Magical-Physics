HUMAN BIOLOGY: PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS (V5.0)
The RF-Evolved Human: Constraints, Lineages, and Hardware

This document defines the universal biological structure and constraints of the RF-Evolved Human (Homo sapiens), establishing the physiological reality for all populations in the Age of Might.
Part 1: Universal Constraints and Energy Budget

All human performance is constrained by the thermodynamic and chemical limits of the RF system, using the bedrock conversion of 1 mana≡3,000 Joules.
1.1 Mana Pool, Income, and Tax

The RF system operates with a high-volume income and a mandatory maintenance tax.

|

| Constraint | Value | Physics Derivation |
| Mana Capacity (EMAX​) | 100 mana units | The Biological Soft Cap: Maximum safe ATP throughput (∼300 kJ). |
| BMR Income (Food Metabolism) | +104.6 mana/hour | Constant influx from food conversion (∼1,800 kcal/day). |
| Passive Drain (RF Tax) | −1.0 mana/hour | Fixed evolutionary cost to maintain the RF defense field. |
1.2 The Universal Complexity Ceiling (Limit of Scale)

The biological limit on the volume of matter any human can precisely track and control at the molecular level, regardless of energy expenditure.
Complexity Ceiling=1024 RF Processing Clusters

| Complexity Tier | Example Material | Maximum Volume Equivalent (Baseline/Zenith) |
| Tier 1: Simple (Kinetic/Thermal) | Air, Steam, Pure Gas | 50 to 100 Liters (∼1 kg of air) |
| Tier 2: Medium (Molecular/Phase) | Liquid Water, Stone, Iron | 5 to 10 Liters (∼5 to 10 kg) |
| Tier 3: High (Biological/Molecular) | Living Tissue, Complex Proteins | 1 to 2 Liters (∼1 to 2 kg) |
Part 2: Systemic RF Hardware (The Universal Baseline)

All humans possess the following structures, granting them universal resilience and capability over real-world humans.

| Structure | Location | Physics Function | Universal Impact |
| Resonance Nodes (ANM) | Deep Brain | Thermal Rectification: Manages waste heat and accelerates ATP for healing (2x to 3x faster healing). |  |
| Somatic RF Conduits | Fascia/Tendon Layers | Kinetic Circuitry: Superconducting pathways that deliver RF energy to muscles, enabling 1.2x to 1.3x base strength. |  |
| Dermal RF Receptor Layer | Skin/Nerve Endings | 360∘ Sensing: A massive detection array feeding data to the Sensory Cortex. |  |
| Core Energy Reservoir | Solar Plexus | The Kinetic Capacitor: Stores and instantly discharges rectified RF energy. |  |
Part 3: Genetic Specialization (The Gilded Lineages)

The specialized lineages evolved over 10,000 years by maximizing specific RF structures. These lineages practice selective breeding to maintain their specialization (The Law of Recessive Specialization).
3.1 The Zenith Lineage (Generator/Warrior)

Optimized for Kinetic Output and Speed. Their structures are hyper-efficient for impulse and recoil management.

| Specialization | Mechanism | Performance Output |
| Speed/Reaction | Short, highly dense neural pathways. | 10 ms to 20 ms Kinetic Reaction Time. |
| Kinetic Force | Optimized Somatic Conduits (Zenith only). | 1.5x to 1.8x physical force multiplier (e.g., 900 kg deadlift). |
| Failure Mode | Conduits Overload: Acute pain and loss of kinetic advantage (1.0 sec recovery lag). |  |
3.2 The Oracle Lineage (Sensor/Intelligence)

Optimized for RF Perception and Defense. Their structures maximize signal input and interference.

| Specialization | Mechanism | Performance Output |
| Sensing Range | Largest Sensory Cortex mass. | 500 m to 1 km passive detection range. |
| Defense | Neural Filter and Shield Generator (Temporal Lobe). | 200 units Active Living Resistance power. |
| Failure Mode | Sensory Overload: Chaotic RF environments cause severe neural distress if the Neural Filter is breached. |  |
3.3 The Adamant Lineage (Sustainer/Mender)

Optimized for Metabolic Efficiency and Recovery. Their focus is maintaining long-duration effects and resource management.

| Specialization | Mechanism | Performance Output |
| Recovery Rate | Hyper-Mitochondrial Core density. | 45 to 55 units/hour recovery rate (Apex). |
| Efficiency/Endurance | Thermal Buffer Matrix (Superior waste management). | Lowest Passive Drain and highest endurance for sustained low-power spells. |
| Physics-Based Trade-Off | Increased Neural Latency: Large Resonance Nodes occupy space, creating longer, more circuitous neural pathways for signal transfer. | Slowest Reaction Time (∼150 ms) and longest casting time among Gilded Lineages. |
Part 4: Technology and Failure Policy
4.1 Universal Technology Integration (55%+ Adoption)

| Technology | RF Structure Enhanced | Physics Function |
| Ambient Mana Accumulator (AMA) | Core Energy Reservoir | External Reserve Battery: Crystal storage bypasses the 100 mana soft cap via instant discharge (∼0.5 mana/hour charge rate). |
| The Resonance Splint | Resonance Nodes | Healing Pattern Stabilizer: Reduces the RF energy cost of healing by 40% to 60% by providing structural pattern support. |
| The Rectification Ward | Resonance Nodes / Sensory Cortex | Tax Reduction: Stabilizes local RF noise during rest, reducing the Passive Drain to 0.2 mana/hour. |
| Kinetic Bracing Tool | Somatic RF Conduits | Recoil Dampener: Spreads the massive kinetic recoil of an RF discharge across the user's core structure. |
4.2 Failure and Debilitation System

Consequences are systemic and cannot be ignored by willpower alone.

| Failure Mode | Mechanism / Trigger | Consequence |
| Coherence Debt | Exceeding the neural thermal limit by rapid energy discharge. | "The Hummer" Pain: Acute pressure in the skull, forcing 6 to 8 hours of mandatory deep sleep to reset. |
| Conduits Overload (Zenith) | Pushing the Somatic Conduits beyond safe kinetic throughput. | Loss of Advantage: Temporary paralysis/spasms, reversing their recovery rate to the slow human baseline (≈1.0 second lag). |
| Pattern Failure | Exceeding the 1024 Complexity Ceiling. | Backlash/Seizure: Released chaotic RF energy channels back into the neural pathways, causing systemic trauma. |
| Hardship Atrophy | Chronic malnutrition/stress during formative years. | Permanently Stunted Capacity (50 to 70 units) and suppressed healing/endurance rates. |
