# Chapter 3: What We Become

# Part I: The Third Morning

Vert woke to find Gyouu at the window again, this time arranging their coins in neat rows on the windowsill.

"Twenty silver pieces," she reported without turning. "Duration of sleep: 24,480 Marks. Nightmare frequency decreased by twenty-three percent from baseline. Physical recovery is progressing within expected parameters."

The hunger was manageable now—yesterday's soup had given him enough strength to think clearly. But his hands still ached with phantom pain from crushing the Bowljin's throat, and when he closed his eyes, he could still feel the crack of cartilage beneath his fingers.

"We need real work," he said, testing his legs as he stood. Steadier than yesterday. "Not just... what we did."

Gyouu turned from the window, attempting one of her practiced expressions—concern, maybe. It still looked wrong, but less wrong than before.

"Agreed. Legitimate employment provides social camouflage and sustainable resources." She paused, making the small, quiet cough she'd been practicing. "I mean... yes. We should find jobs."

"Better," Vert said, a hint of a real smile touching his lips. "The cough is almost natural now."
Part II: The Dock Ward

The path to the docks led through the Lowjin quarter. The small, furry creatures had claimed several blocks near the water, their architecture distinctive—rounded doorways barely four feet high, windows at ground level, everything built for bodies that preferred scurrying to walking upright.

"Their social structure is fascinating," Gyouu observed quietly as a pack of them watched from a storefront, their cat-like eyes following their movements. "Young scout for threats, adults coordinate hunting patterns, elderly provide strategic—"

"You sound interested," Vert interrupted.

"Pattern recognition helps predict behavior. Useful for threat assessment." She caught herself again. "I mean... they are interesting to watch."

The morning labor selection was already underway when they reached the docks. Hundreds of men stood in rough lines while foremen walked among them, selecting the strongest for the day's loading work. The smell of tar and rotting fish made Vert's empty stomach turn.

He joined a line. His height helped him stand out, but when a foreman approached—a Gojin with pink skin glistening with sweat—the creature took one look at Vert's stance and shook his head.

"Not hiring soldiers."

"I'm not a soldier anymore—"

"You stand like one. Move like one. We don't need that kind of trouble." The Gojin moved on to the next man without a backward glance.

Three more foremen gave the same response. His military conditioning, once his greatest asset, now marked him as dangerous and unemployable.

As they were leaving the docks, they heard a rhythmic beat against creaky wood, punctuated by hissing and the click of many claws on stone. Vert turned, noticing Gyouu had already pivoted to face the sound.

Ten Lowjins emerged from an alley, moving in that quick, low way he'd seen before. The leader wore a patched-together top hat and a vest that had seen better days. All of them carried crude, rusty shanks.

"Hisssss, COIN OR DIE!" the one with the hat screeched, its cat-slit eyes fixed on them.

Vert felt it now—that familiar disconnection. The chaotic sounds of the docks seemed to fade, replaced by a low hum in his ears. A metallic taste flooded his mouth. His vision didn't just shift; it sharpened, the edges of the world becoming unnaturally clear as his body prepared to act without his permission.

"Threat assessment: minimal," Gyouu said calmly, her voice carrying that analytical tone. "Ten subjects, crude weaponry, predictable pack tactics. Termination time if required: approximately 12.3 Marks."

The smallest Lowjin moved with a pitter-patter of rapid steps, hissing as it charged toward Vert. Gyouu stepped forward—no flourish, no threat display, just repositioning herself between Vert and the creature with unnatural smoothness.

The Lowjin skidded to a stop. Something was wrong. Every instinct screamed danger, but it couldn't sense any killing intent—no anger, no fear, no anticipation. Just... nothing. A void where emotion should be.

Gyouu tilted her head, her auditory sensors analyzing the frequency and cadence of their hisses. Then she opened her mouth and produced a perfect reproduction of their battle-hiss: "HISSSSS, COIN OR DIE!"

The sound was wrong in a way that made Vert's skin crawl—too perfect, like she'd copied something that shouldn't be copied. The leader's fur stood on end. This thing wearing a child's shape had just spoken their language better than they could.

The leader fumbled for his pouch, threw it at her feet, and fled. The others scattered instantly, their primitive minds understanding: whatever this was, it wasn't prey.

Gyouu bent to pick up the pouch, noting the small weight. "Decoy. Real currency still under his hat. Shall I pursue?"

"No," Vert said, his voice shaky. He was leaning against the wall, one hand covering his sweating face. "I want to go back to the inn."

    Time since curiosity event: 1,049,356 Marks. Subject displaying signs of dissociative episode. Priority: immediate extraction to safe location.
